0,Why are yawns contagious?,"When your body need more oxygen  you yawn.When you yawn  you take more oxygen in the air.If the density of the oxygen in the air becomes lower  other people (their bodies) can feel that and start to yawn to get more oxygen.That's why yawns are contagious. Yawning is extremely contagious -- 55% of people who witness someone yawn will yawn within five minutes. If a visually impaired person hears a tape of someone yawning  he or she is likely to yawn as well. Face it  the likelihood of you making it to the end of this answer without looking like one of these gaping maws is unlikely.Although the contagious nature of yawning is well established  we know less about why this is so. Researchers are currently giving the topic some serious attention. One theory suggests it's a holdover from a period in evolutionary history when yawning served to coordinate the social behavior of a group of animals. A recent study postulates that contagious yawning could be part of the ""neural network involved in empathy.""While the mystery of contagious yawning has yet to be solved  perhaps researchers are closing in on an answer. On the other hand  given the subject matter  we wouldn't blame them for falling asleep at the wheel. In the meantime  give the ""yawn challenge"" a try -- it's tougher than it looks."
1,What's the best way to heat up a cold hamburger (In&Out)?,If you must eat a heated In&Out hamburger then I suggest the follow:First  scrape the ketchup  mayo and any other sauce that is on the hamburger and put it a side. Also take the vegetables out.Second  pre-heat a steak pan; put the hamburger separate form the bun on the hot panThird  heat up both parts of the bun near the hamburger on the same hot pan (you can get some souce from the hamburger on it)Fourth  you can either put back the original ketchup  mayo and the vegetables or  better yet  get new ones from what you have at home .Bon Appetite
2,Vacation rentals in the Turks and Caicos,I like Providenciales best. Beautiful beaches are scattered on all sides of Providenciales  the most spectacular of which is a 12 mile stretch located on Grace Bay  which is protected by a healthy barrier reef. Provo has an 18 hole golf course  a casino  shopping centres  three marinas  a growing number of of bars and excellent restaurants. Provo is also a divers' and water lovers' paradise.

5,why doesn't an optical mouse work on a glass table?,Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse.  The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. Some materials  such as glass  mirrors or other very shiny  uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.Since glass is transparent and very uniform  the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion.  Mirrored surfaces are also a problem  since they constantly reflect back the same image  causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement  the mouse will not work properly.
6,Why did the U.S Invade Iraq ?,A small group of politicians believed strongly that the fact that Saddam Hussien remained in power after the first Gulf War was a signal of weakness to the rest of the world  one that invited attacks and terrorism. Shortly after taking power with George Bush in 2000 and after the attack on 9/11  they were able to use the terrorist attacks to justify war with Iraq on this basis and exaggerated threats of the development of weapons of mass destruction. The military strength of the U.S. and the brutality of Saddam's regime led them to imagine that the military and political victory would be relatively easy.
7,best finish for concrete surfaces,it depends what you're looking for  and what tolerance you have for cost.simple plain finish (and similarly broom finish which is basically going over the wet concrete with a broom to make patterns) are very cheap but also have a basic look (cheap look).high end finish is imprinted concrete  which can make it look like natual stone or bricks - very flexible. this tends to be MUCH more expensive.another thing to consider is that concrete surfaces tend to crack  and this shows at different levels in different finishes. impronted and plain finish tends to show the cracks very prominently. other finishes like exposed aggregate (small pebbles on top of the concrete that are exposed and showing on top) tend to have cracks be less visible.i attached an example of one company that provides different finishes. from my experience they are way overpriced so you want to shop around.

9,What is Trans Fat? How to reduce that?,"Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation  when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat  which raises ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease.Until very recently  food labels were not required to list trans fats  and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. In early July  FDA regulations changed  and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods."
10,When does a kid usually move from sleeping in a crib to sleeping in a bed?,There's no set time. It depends more on why you want to move him/her to a bed.Is the kid is too big for the crib?But does that balance out against whether you want the kid to be getting out of bed at night on their own  and whether you feel comfortable about the risk of them rolling off the bed in their sleep.Look at the reference for first-hand accounts.
11,Roth IRA Vs 401K?,If your company has 401K benefit  you should join it because the money you deposit into the account doesn't need to pay tax at that time (more than 10K a year).Roth IRA is after-tax and has some restriction.  You won't be able to use Roth if your income is higher than certain amount. Also  you need to pay tax for those amount.  Only the capital gain is not taxble.If your company has 401K  I suggest that you use 401K.  If you don't work in certain year  then use Roth IRA to leverage the tax.
12,Cascading Style Sheets,"PRO: CSS is designed to allow the separation of presentation and structure. Font colors  background styles  element alignments  borders and sizes are moved into a stylesheet  resulting in considerably simpler HTML code. The HTML documents become much smaller and web browsers will usually cache sites' CSS stylesheets. This leads to a reduction in network traffic and noticeably quicker page downloads.CON:Naming can get confusing.  For example  authors might associate the class name with desired presentational attributes; for example  a CSS class to be applied to emphasized text might be named ""bigred "" implying that it is rendered in a large red font. While such a choice of naming may be intuitive to the document author  it can cause problems if the author later decides that the emphasized text should instead be green; the author is left with a CSS class called ""bigred"" that describes something that is green.There are bugs in CSS that you need to work out when you need it to work across multiple browsers&platforms  and its harder to debug than with a simple HTML."

14,In the san francisco bay area  does it make sense to rent or buy ?,renting vs buying depends on your goals.generally thinking is that buying is better b/c the payments that would go into the rent start building equity in your home. the govt also incentivizes you to buy by making your property tax payments and mortgage interest payments tax deductible.having said that current housing status in the bay area is such that housing cost to purchase is relatively high and rental prices (compared to ownership cost) are relatively low (relative to the rest of the country). it makes lese sense to buy vs. other places.bottom line you should base your decision on whether you think the market will keep going up or not. the other numbers tend to even out  the main gain or loss in buying comes from appreciation/depreciation.
15,"Why is it called ""Heavy Metal"" music?","brhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music#Origins_of_.22heavy_metal.22The origin of the term heavy metal is uncertain. An early use of the term was by counter-culture writer William S. Burroughs. In his 1962 novel The Soft Machine  he introduces the character ""Uranian Willy  the Heavy Metal Kid"". His next novel in 1964 Nova Express  develops this theme further  heavy metal being a metaphor for addictive drugs.""With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms - Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes - And the Insect People of Minraud with metal music""Burroughs  William S  (1964). Nova Express. New York: Grove Press. p. 112Given the publication dates of these works it is unlikely that Burroughs had any intent to relate the term to rock music; however Burroughs' writing may have influenced later usage of the term.The first use of the term ""heavy metal"" in a song lyric is the words ""heavy metal thunder"" in the 1968 Steppenwolf song ""Born to be Wild"" (Walser 1993  p. 8):""I like smoke and lightningHeavy metal thunderRacin' with the windAnd the feelin' that I'm under""The word ""heavy"" (meaning serious or profound) had entered beatnik/counterculture slang some time earlier  and references to ""heavy music"" typically slower  more amplified variations of standard pop fare were already common; indeed  Iron Butterfly first started playing Los Angeles in 1967  their name explained on an album cover  ""Iron- symbolic of something heavy as in sound  Butterfly- light  appealing and versatile...an object that can be used freely in the imagination"" Iron Butterfly's 1968 debut album was entitled Heavy. The fact that Led Zeppelin (whose moniker came partly in reference to Keith Moon's jest that they would ""go down like a lead balloon"") incorporated a heavy metal into its name may have sealed the usage of the term.In the late 1960s  Birmingham  England was still a centre of industry and (given the many rock bands that evolved in and around the city  such as Led Zeppelin  The Move  and Black Sabbath) some people suggest that the term Heavy Metal may have some relation to such activity. Biographies of The Move have claimed that the sound came from their 'heavy' guitar riffs that were popular amongst the 'metal midlands'.Sandy Pearlman  original producer  manager and songwriter for Blue Ayster Cult  claims to have been the first person to apply the term ""heavy metal"" to rock music in 1970.A widespread but disputed hypothesis about the origin of the genre was brought forth by ""Chas"" Chandler  who was a manager of the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1969  in an interview on the PBS TV programme ""Rock and Roll"" in 1995. He states that ""...it [heavy metal] was a term originated in a New York Times article reviewing a Jimi Hendrix performance""  and claims the author described the Jimi Hendrix Experience ""...like listening to heavy metal falling from the sky"". The precise source of this claim  however  has not been found and its accuracy is disputed.The first well-documented usage of the term ""heavy metal"" referring to a style of music  appears to be the May 1971 issue of Creem  in a review of Sir Lord Baltimore's Kingdom Come. In this review we are told that ""Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book"".Regardless of its origin  heavy metal may have been used as a jibe initially but was quickly adopted by its adherents. Other  already-established bands  such as Deep Purple  who had origins in pop or progressive rock  immediately took on the heavy metal mantle  adding distortion and additional amplification in"
16,what is the best photo slideshow creation application,"I recently tried two products to create an end-of-the-season slideshow for my childrens swim team  MyDVD 6.1 from Sonic Solution and PictureShow 3 from ULead.The first product  MyDVD 6.1 was easy to use  but had an unacceptable flaw and was missing a really great feature. When creating long slideshows (99 slides)  the software automatically created chapter points. The problem was  that the audio would drop out at each chapter  creating unpleasant silence at seemingly random intervals in the show (~4-5x during my slide show).  Since their customer support had no recommendations on solving the problem  I was forced to look elsewhere.The second product PictureShow 3 from Ulead  not only solved that problem  but added a feature that I really think is a ""must have"".  The feature  known as the ""Ken Burns"" effect  subtly zooms or pans the photo within the frame during playback.  This allows a slide show to have a sense of motion.  Everyone that viewed the DVD I created universally liked the effect and commented on the ""cool"" factor.The UI for adding multiple audio tracks could be improved  but it does allow frame level control over positioning the audio.  The DVD burning process on a large number of 8MP photos took about an hour for 260 photos  which was longer than MyDVD took for a similar task. The project templates and menu backgrounds provided for both products were a bit weak for my taste  so I used a custom background for my main menu.All-in-all PictureShow 3 did a great job for me.  The slide show was a great success and the audience of ~200-300 people who viewed it at the end of the season were impressed by the quality and I got numerous positive comments."

18,what is the meaning of life ?,"To answer this question  you need to step back.  You'll notice that most fish and frogs do not ponder life's meaning.  In fact  as far as we can tell  most animals live life the best they can and don't waste much time pondering the ""meaning"" of it all.  Given that we are descended from them  then an appropriate preface to your question is ""why do we even ask about meaning?""The best answer that anthropologists have to date is that sometime around the time that our brains started to recognize our own mortality as a concept  the behavior of ancient societies started to change.  We began to bury our dead  and we began to have animistic proto-religions.This was all sparked by the human ability to recognize cause and effect.  This was essential for tool-making  and it set up the mental construct -- if this  then that.  Which set up the possibility for the construct called meaning: (i.e. if I observed that  then it means that this happened).  Now this type of simple causal reasoning allowed us to do all manner of things... from building stone tools toward developing science  technology and forming societies with rules  etc.But that same reasoning applied to the question of existence becomes a lot less clear.  Causal reasoning would say: if I am here  then it means that some other thing must be true.  If also say  if I do something  then it is more useful (and easier to understand) if it has a meaning than if it doesn't.  Now the problem is that life does not have any meaning in particular.  For a while human kind got along pretty well by creating artificial systems of meaning... usually around religion or work  but the existentialists came along and pulled the rug right out from under this type of thinking.Given that life has no absolute top-down meaning  we are left with just a few options.  We can get meaning by subscribing to one of the old constructs (religion  etc)  or we can do what Nietche suggested and have each individual define a system of meaning for themselves.  This is easier said than done  but is probably the only way to estable meaning without subscribing to the illusions of others.Outside of these approaches  which are decided Western in their origins  we can take an Eastern approach.  This is simply to state that it not important to have meaning.  Life simply is.  Whether we reach this non-meaning state by flowing with the Tao  or do it by transcedental meditation that allows us to escape from our sense of self (and thus our personal need for meaning)  we simply leave meaning on the doorstep.  This is helpful  because the question of the ""meaning of life"" may actually just be an absurd question... and a well considered answer to an absurd question is simply absurd.Anyhow  I hope that helps."

20,What's the best way to clean a keyboard?,There are commercial kits available  but a can of compressed air  a lint-free cloth or wipes  mild dishwashing liquid  and a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush are all you really need for a basic cleaning.After turning off your computer and unplugging your keyboard  gently shake the keyboard upside down over some newspaper to dislodge loose crumbs and particles.Use the can of compressed air to blow a stream of air between the keys.Dampen a lint-free cloth with a diluted solution of dishwashing liquid and water to wipe down the keys.Use the vacuum cleaner brush attachment to suck away any remaining dirt or debris.If you have a membrane-type keyboard (it doesn't have a spring under each key) and the keys are truly grungy  you can remove the keys with a small screwdriver and use cotton swabs and 90% isopropyl alcohol to get it sparkling clean. If you are still feeling industrious  next you can tackle cleaning your mouse.Of course  if cleaning your keyboard seems a truly undesirable task  you can always buy a new one for around $20.
21,looking for a new bike,Finding the right bike for excercising is more about fit than anything else. Riding a bike that does not fit will cause pain and likely also knee and/or back problems. The for starters part indicates that you potentially want more  so I will recommend finding a good local shop that can measure you and find a bike of the correct size with the right angles for you. In my area I can recommend http://bicycleoutfitter.com/site/intro.cfm and http://www.cupertinobike.com/. Both are experts in finding and adjusting a bike just for you. Cupertinobike is perhaps a bit more for the hardcore riders. Please dont forget to buy a good pair of bike shorts. And for the saddle we are all different  but soft is not necessarily more comfy in the long run.

23,What is the singel most important thing you are missing on the internet ?,I think that the best thing about the internet is that you CAN be anonymous. I agree that there should be a single identity that a user can use in secured web sites  like banks  but I prefer it to be an identity specific to the category and not to the entire internet. Meaning  if you look at the FICO number and what affect it (being late in the supermarket affect you car insurance) I rather not repeat that in the internet world. So my suggestion is to have separate identity to separate categories – the Banks’ web site will have their own identity database and it will be a different one form the gambling industry  etc.
24,Why do people blush when they are embarrassed?,"from ask yahoo...http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040113.htmlBlushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system  which is responsible for our ""fight or flight"" response  but blushing is solely triggered by social cues.People generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed  scared  or stressed. As a result of the ""fight or flight"" response  the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen  and the increased blood flow lends the face  as well as sometimes the chest  neck  or even the body or legs  a reddened color.Excessive facial blushing  or erythrophobia  is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups.It's common knowledge that animals don't blush. So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing  it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness."
25,what is the better way to grill outdoors: gas or charcoal?,I say Charcoal !  but here are the pros and cons for charcoal and gas grillsCharcoal ProsFood tastes better. That smoked flavor is impossible to duplicate with gas even if you buy the smoke products.Charcoal grills are less expensive.  A quality charcoal grill runs between $50 and $100.It's easy to find portable charcoal grills to take on trips.Cooking over charcoal becomes an event. If family members get hooked on cooking over charcoal  they will enjoy playing around with different techniques.Charcoal ConsStarting a fire can be a problem especially on damp or rainy days. It does help to keep the charcoal good and dry and an electric firestarter can also be used.It's easy to burn food over charcoal. The heat is regulated with vents  and the cook must know how to use the vents and lid to keep the fire from flaring or burning too hot.Coals must cool before the grill can be cleaned. This can take several hours.A charcoal grill is messy. Grease  charcoal and ashes are not the easiest things to clean up.Gas ProsStarting a gas grill is as easy as turning on the gas and pushing a button. Do be careful and follow directions.Flames and temperatures can be fine tuned with the settings on a gas grill. If you have recipes that call for temperature settings and times  then gas is super simple.Most gas grills have two sides with separate controls  so it's easy to cook two different things at once even if they require different amounts of heat.Clean up is really easy.Gas ConsFood cooked on a gas grill does not have charcoal flavor no matter what you do.Gas grills cost more. Expect to pay at least $100 for a good gas grill. Some run in the thousands.Most gas grills are large and are hard to take on trips.If you run out of gas  you're out of luck

27,Can boys and girls be just friends?,"Boys don't think so. Girls do. Hmmm. I've seen this in a movie. But I don't think they are mutually exclusive. Boys can fantasize about being lovers with a girl  and girls can believe that boys ""just want to be friends"" with them.  Denial works pretty well to keep a friendship together."
28,"Is Lin Qingxia (aka Brigitte Lin) ""the most beautiful woman in Chinese cinema?""","Well.  Everyone has different definition on what 'beauty' is.  I like Lin Qingxia  but I think many girls are prettier than she was. (She is more than 40 years old now).If ""Lin Qingxia"" is the most beautiful woman in the Chinese cinema  the most handsome man in Chinese cinema should be ""Chin Han"" because they always made movies together.However  A male movie star once was asked his girlfriend in real life or the girlfriend in movie is more beautiful.  He gave a very good answer: ""I think my mother is the most beautiful woman in the world.""  :)"
29,"What is the origin of ""foobar""?","Not sure if this is the origin  but I think it was popularized in the 1989 film ""Tango&Cash"". After Tango  played by Sylvester Stallone  and Cash  portrayed by Kurt Russell  were thrown into jail and setup in a failed jailbreak attempt  the bad guy Yves Perret (Jack Pallance) locked them in the boiler room with a bunch of felons Tango&Cash had put in jail. Prior to unleashing a can of whoop-ass  their conversation was as follows:Gabriel Cash: I don't know about you  but I have an aversion to getting F.U.B.A.R...Ray Tango: What's F.U.B.A.R.?Gabriel Cash: Fucked-Up Beyond All Recognition."
30,How the human species evolved?,"A tough question as it overlaps science and theology. Since you asked ""how the human species evolved?"" I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.The current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. The pressures for ""fit"" are competitive (with each other  with other tribes  and with other animals) and environmental (weather  terrain  availability of food  etc.). These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain  which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication&technology."
31,What makes friendship click?,good communication is what does it.  Can you move beyond small talk and say what's really on your mind.  If you start doing this  my expereince is that potentially good friends will respond or shun you.  Then you know who the really good friends are.
32,Who said the statement below and what does it mean?,"That is kind of a tricky little quote. Sometimes placing it in context can help. This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay ""Self Reliance "" which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm).I think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions  and to live by them.  It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the ""independence of solitude""). However  not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society  it's something only a ""finished man"" can truly do. Also  in the essay  Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish  non-judgmental  open-minded  uncynical  unhesitant - as something to admire. So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced ""perfect sweetness"" comes in. When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals.What do you think?"

34,What are some tips on finding a good mortgage broker?,the most basic thing is to have someone you have a decent amount of trust for. someone recommended by a friend etc.the things you have to look for are:1. top priority is seeing that the broker can actually get your loan on time. many deals fall through b/c the broker cannot get the deal through on time and has less control than the original lender2. secondary priority is to see that they have access to competitive rates. not all brokers have access to all sources and rates  although most of them will be similar.3. you need to see that the broker is someone you trust to get you the best rate regardless of how much money they make off the transaction.

36,what's the best way to create a bootable windos/dos CD?,Well  the best way is to look at whatever program you have for burning CDs and see if it has an option to create a bootable CD.  If you can't find it  or use Windows itself to burn CDs  then it's a little more complicated.Note: If you find that booting from CD doesn't work  you may have to adjust your BIOS setting to allow your machine to boot from CD.If you want to boot to windows: the easiest way is probably to go here: http://www.nu2.nu/bootcd/ and download a utility that will do it for you.  There are instructions there depending on what type of boot you want.If you don't trust using a third party utility  Microsoft has some instructions here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167685/EN-US/ .  This process is not very straightforward though.If you just need to get into your filesystem and poke around  you might consider booting a different OS.  For example  http://www.freedos.org/ (FreeDOS) and http://www.knoppix.net/ (Knoppix Linux) may do what you want.  For these  you can download ISO images and burn bootable CDs.
37,what is the reason for the increasing divorce percentage in the western world?,IMO... our lives are much more complex than our equivalents from 50 years ago and thus it's more likely for married people to grow in different directions over time (values  needs  etc.). Add to that how easy and acceptable it is to get a divorce  and how quick we are to dispose of things that we no longer want  and you get an increasing percentage.I wouldn't be surprised if in the not too distant future the average length of a marriage drops to ~5 years and the average number of marriages per person increases to 2+.A parallel to consider: how many different circles of friends do you have and how often have you joined new ones and left others behind over your life? (grade school  high school  college  jobs  etc.). We are a nomadic species. :)
38,"What is an ""imaginary number""?",Imaginary numbers are numbers than when squared equal a negative number  as in i^2 = -1  where i is the imaginary number. You'll also often see them represented as i = √-1 (that's the square root of -1).Don't be confused by the poorly chosen name - imaginary numbers do indeed exist and are used in advanced math  such as in the physics of electromagnetic fields. The analogy that Wikipedia uses is a good one - just like you don't need the concept of fractions to count stones  it doesn't mean that fractions don't exist. :)

41,what are the benefits of using a CF card reader vs. transferring using a digital camera,Many cameras use the older USB 1.1 standard for transferring data  which is slow.  USB 1.1 can run in two modes (Low speed 1.5 Mbits/sec and Full speed 12.0 Mbits/sec).  Your actual speed will be lower than theoretical maximum.  USB 2.0 the newer standard supports 480 Mbits/sec. maximum.  FireWire and PCMCIA are even faster.With an external reader  you are not limited by what you camera supports  but by what your PC supports  so you can get higher speed interfaces such as PCMCIA  FireWire or USB 2.0  even if your camera doesn't support it.  I've found USB 2.0 to provide acceptable (not blazing  but reasonable) performance  even with high-res 8MP images.
42,What's the least expensive way to make a movie using local talent?,I would try some of the local schools like the Academy of Arts College (http://www.academyart.edu/) to see if you find someone willing to work for cheap in exchange for some resume-building experience. There seems to be a lot of posting on Craigslist (http://craigslist.org) for various technicians as well so that may be another option. If you have friends or contacts with people who work at some of the local movie companies (Lucasfilm or Pixar)  I know there are usually aspiring filmmakers doing side projects. I believe ILM has an internal mailing list for talent  both on camera and off. I played an extra in an Indie film by a former ILM employee. My friend who works there forwarded me the internal call for extras. Finally  if you can tap into local theatre and/or acting groups  you may find contacts with technicians.

There are some experiments where splitting entangled electrons allows us to observe some interesting 'action at a distance' effects  but the amount of data that would need to be stored to transmit something with as many atoms as a pizza is incredible.  Also  such an operation would require nano-assemblers that could interpret such data an reassemble the pizza from the info provided.
44,can i repair/seal a crack in a toilet tank?,A silicone sealant should work fine as long as you make sure the porcelain around the crack is dry and clean of loose debris when you put it on  and you give it at least 24 hours to dry before it gets wet again.If you want something even more industrial  you can use JB Weld. It's a simple 2-part epoxy that has amazing strength and is used for bonding metal  porcelain  etc. I used some a couple of years ago to bond a stainless towel bar onto the front of my porcelain kitchen sink and it's still there and rock solid even though it constantly gets bumped&banged.
45,What are good sources to find out about new gospel artists?,CCM Magazine or their online website will give you information on up and coming artists in the Christian Music field.
46,What's the best strategy to win playing Craps?,they say craps is one of those games you can come as close to reducing the house edge to 50% as possible  but the key is knowing how to bet in order to get to that point.once the point is established  there are a few things you can do to maximize the return when it hits. you'll see most people putting a bet behind the line. for an incremental investment beyond what you've already got on the line  you'll get odds on what you bet behind the line. if the point is an even number (say 8)  a small bet on the hard 8 would fetch a nice return if 4-4 is rolled.one interesting strategy is betting the pass line  behind the pass line  place bet 5  6 and 8 (as long as they're not the point)  and the field. you'll notice you have all numbers covered except for 7. note that the amounts you bet will have to make sense. if you only placed $6 on 8  putting $10 in the field doesn't make sense since when an 8 hits  you'll lose 3 (win $7 from the place bet and lose $10 on the field). notice that as long as your betting levels make sense AND the shooter doesn't crap out  you get paid.most will say that one roll bets like the field  CnEs  horn bets  etc. are sucker bets since you're betting on a specific combination for only the next roll.main take away should be that you have to spread your money around and play more than the pass line to win.
47,Is coffee bad for your skin?,There are pros and cons in using coffee for skin care.Pros- coffee contains antioxidant that can help fight skin cancer.- some preliminary studies show that topically applied coffee can yield beautiful skin.Cons- coffee is a mild diurectic. If drunk in large quantity  coffee can cause dehydration of the skin.- drinking coffee can interfere with a good night's sleep  which is essential to good skin.So drinking small amount of coffee shouldn't affect the health of skin. But at large quantity  you should talk to your doctor first to find out if the antioxidant benefit is worth it. There are other ways to prevent skin cancer. One of the best ways is to use a broad spectrum sunscreen everyday even when the weather is cloudy.
48,Why is Silicon Valley a cultural wasteland?,"In short: cars and zoning laws.Culture is a vaguely defined concept  but in my definition it refers to the creative expression of humanity  i.e. culture opposes nature in that it is what is made  not found. Included is the arts  the architecture  the built environment  the civic life of the streets  the events taking place in the community  and cities have traditionally been the places where much of this activity is concentrated. Thus your recognition of San Francisco as where the concentration of culture in the Bay Area.It is a much repeated fact that the entirety of Medieval Florence would fit into one average Phoenix area intersection.Silicon Valley has the misfortune of having come of age after WWII  and post-WWII ""cities"" were environments designed for cars and not for people. Cars insulate people from one another  prevent the fruitful mixing of different classes and different races. Environments built for cars include parking lots  strip malls  and houses dominated by garages and not front porches  and front porches are a big part of street level society.Cars lead to self-segregation almost as much as suburban development does. Suburban development is largely segregated by income level: a $100 000 house is never built next to a $500 000 house  and god forbid if an apartment building went up next door. And no one needs to point out that all the houses look more or less the same.Building a city  in the traditional understanding of what a city comprises  is no longer legal in most parts of the country. Zoning laws of most cities prohibit the building of streets with back alleys  or foregrounding the culture of the street over the need to park. It's not possible to build traditional streets with retail on the first floor  offices on the second  and living spaces above. It's not possible to put commerce and residential together. Even in big cities  there is often a ""dead downtown"" -- after work  everyone leaves and the streets die.You can see an effort to build a New Urbanist street in the case of Santana Row  in San Jose. That it feels a lot like a shopping mall denigrates the experience somewhat  but if other developers in surrounding blocks picked up the same torch  and mom and pop stores could move in instead of big box retail  you'd have the beginnings of a new town.To read more on the subject check out Suburban Nation: The Death of the American Dream by Andres Duany  Elizabeth Plater-Zybeck and Jeff Speck. Also read The Death and Life of American Cities by Jane Jacobs  a classic. And read more on New Urbanism: http://www.newurbanism.org/"
49,what is the different between MPEG  MPEG2  AVI and WMV,There is a confusing alphabet soup of acronyms for video.  In the list above  you actually have three different types of entities: standards organizations (MPEG)  encodings (MPEG2  WMV) and containers (AVI  WMV).From the standards committees  comes specs to implement conforming encoders/decoders for multiple variations of the standards.  For example  MPEG2 or MPEG4  which can be implemented with various profiles and levels.  Levels are used to support variations such as standard definition vs. high-definition.Container types serve to make it even more confusing.  Think of a container type as the file extension/file format for all those audio and video files.  Many types of containers support multiple types of encodings inside.  For example  the popular .avi file format can contain different types of video encodings. Also  keep in mind that .mpg files can also contain different audio endodings (e.g. Dolby Digital vs. PCM vs. MPEG1-Layer2)Lastly  some people just have to be different  like Microsoft.  The WMV format can be thought of as both a container and an encoding.  It's a container  because it's a file format for packaging video data.  It's an encoding  because Microsoft implemented a non-standard variant of MPEG4.Now  back to practical issues.  First  decide if you want your video to make DVD's or to use on your PC.  If it's DVD's  the answer is simple  because DVD's are MPEG2 currently.  Use MPEG2  unless you want to hassle re-encoding. If it's to use on a computer or some other special application  then you have more options.  The two big variables are quality and size.  Newer encoding formats such as MPEG4 and WMV achieve significantly better compression  without sacrificing quality.  You may find better tools available for MPEG2 though  since it is the reigning king.  Look for the newer encodings to blow it away in the future  especially as the move to high-definition video takes hold.
50,I want to drink 8 glasses of water everyday as recommended by doctors. However,Try using a squeeze bottle and carrying it around with you.  You can take sips all day long rather than trying to take in full glasses at one time.
51,space missions,You also need to consider the economic effects of funding basic research.  The moon missions of the 60's inspired an entire generation and helped to move many kids toward careers in science and engineering.  As a result  the US was well poised to take advantage of the huge boom in information technology in the last few decades.  The net effect of these engineers in the workforce could be see has a pretty impressive return on investment for the cost of those missions.
52,Brush or sponge for washing your car?,Sponges made for specifically for washing cars and non-stick cooking surfaces are good. I wouldn't use a brush unless it was made for washing cars.
53,Good web design firm in SF?,Punchcut (http://www.punchcut.com/) is a great design firm. Very strong in brand  UI communication and web design  the founders were creative directors from old school Razorfish who have worked on 3com.com  siebel.com  java.com  veritas.com. Most of these sites have been redesigned but they did work for some big name clients.
54,How a black hole is formed?,The current scientific theory holds that black holes are formed when stars of sufficient mass (about 3x the mass of our Sun) reach the end of their life and collapse down into a singularity  which is  in essence  an infinitely small point with a huge amount of gravity - gravity so powerful that not even light can escape it's pull if it gets too close. It is also thought that black holes can be formed from smaller masses if external energy/pressure is exerted to squeeze the mass into a singularity.Not sure if there's any direct experimental evidence of creation  but there is evidence that they exist. Cosmologists use several different methods to detect blacks holes  such as by looking for light being bent and/or disappearing as it travels from remote stars towards us  and also by looking for bursts of x-rays that are given off as matter is sucked into the back hole and destroyed.Fun fact: current evidence and theory suggests that the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole that was formed as the densly packed stars in the center collapsed and sucked each other in.
55,Restaurant recommendation,Not 100% sure about the Vegan stuff  but Flea Street Cafe is a great restaurant that focuses on organic foods and has many vegetarian dishes. A variety of my hard core veggie friends swear by the place.It's in Menlo across from the Dutch Goose on Alameda de las Pulgas.
56,Heavy water,Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom (H20) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom (D20). Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.Water is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed  and to absorb heat. Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction. Any water around it absorbs those neutrons (becoming heavy water) and slows the reaction. If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water  the neutrons are not absorbed. This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction. For example unrefined uranium  which is much less expensive  can be used instead of enriched uranium.
57,When will Her Majesty be released in Dvd format?,It's already available in Australia  if your DVD player can handle PAL:
58,How can I avoid getting sick in China?,Number one cause of digestive complaints is the water. Be especially careful to avoid any beverage that has not been pasteurized and vaccuum sealed  or else boiled (such as tea). Avoid ice like the plague  as well as anything such as raw fruits and vegetables that may have been rinsed prior to serving.On the flip side  most Chinese food is cooked at high heat and therefore is safe as long as no one has touched it with their hands (unlikely given the high temperatures!). That goes for your hands too  wash your hands frequently and always use chopsticks.Finally  pack a bottle of Pepto Bismol  widely regarded (even in medical studies) as the best treatment for mild traveler's diarrhea. If you meticulously follow the suggestions above you shouldn't encounter any problems Pepto can't handle.I've traveled in Central America  North Africa  and Asia following these simple guidelines and never gotten sick. However  for much more detailed info  see the link below:

61,How to get rid of a beehive?,Call an area apiarist.  They should be able to help you and would most likely remove them at no charge in exchange for the hive.  The bees have value and they now belong to you.
62,Which is the best mobile phone service in the Bay area?,at&t (cingular) is supposedly the best but is expensive. verizon is also rumored to be good.tmobile is cheaper but has HORRIBLE coverage and poor customer service.
63,Why's juice from orange peel supposed to be good for eyes?,Orange peel contains d-limonene  which is best known as a solvent (many citrus cleaning products rely on it).The medicinal usas of Orange peel and d-limonene are usually related to heartburn or Gastro intestinal reflux disease (GERD). Orange peel extracts are also said to inhibit cancer cells from dividing and growing.However  I haven't heard of orange peel or d-limonene used for the eyes. From personal experience I can tell you getting the peel extract into your eyes (as sometimes happens when peeling an orange) is usually very painful and stingy...
64,Nice apartment building near SBC Park?,I can't tell you which of the many are best  but I can tell you about one I lived in briefly.I lived for a month in the Avalon at 4th and King. I was put up there as a corporate apartment. While it was fine  it was relatively expensive  and the rooms were small. It also had one of those rooms that served as kitchen  dining room and living room all in one. I'm not fond of these kinds of rooms  which are particularly American. The smell of cooking  people watching TV  people eating -- these all seem like activities that should be separated from one another. Call me old fashioned.The Avalon had a big gym  however  which was very good  and concierge service  which was very convenient. Most of them were very friendly. One concierge even hugged me when we left and said she was going to miss me!  Also convenient was its proximity to the Caltrain  the Safeway across the street and the Starbucks. But if you crave culture  this ain't it: everything is a chain store nearby.So depending on your budget  your need for convenience and culture  and your tolerance for small rooms and/or omnirooms  it may suit you.
65,Global Warming,"Based on a study commissioned by the United Nations  global warming is projected to increase the average tempature by 3.5 degrees over the next century.  According to the IPCC (Inter-govermental Panel on Climate Change) the likely result would be that sea levels would rise by  between 0.09 and 0.88 meters. While lots of the experts disagree on the details  even if the entire Greenland Ice Sheet melted and West Antartic Ice Sheet fell into the sea  its projected that the sea level would rise roughly 10 meters.  While this would definitely cause big problems  especially in low lying coastal areas  it doesn't appear possible that it would ""flood the rest of the world"". Check out the Earth Observatory website by NASA for more details."
66,What are world's 3 smallest nations?,1. The Vatican City in central Rome ranks as the smallest nation of the world. It measures 0.17 square miles.2. Monaco.3. San Marino.How did they manage to become countries?1. The political freedom of the Vatican is guaranteed and protected by Italy. It concordat between the Holy See and the kingdom of Italy signed in 1929 in the Lateran Palace  Rome  by Cardinal Gasparri for Pius XI and by Benito Mussolini for Victor Emmanuel III.2. Monaco came under French protection in 1861. However from 1911  when the first constitution was promulgated  the prince of Monaco was an absolute ruler.3. According to tradition  Marino  a Christian stonecutter from Dalmatia  took refuge (4th cent) on Mt. Titano  the chief geographical feature of present-day San Marino. By the mid-5th cent.  a community was formed; because of its relatively inaccessible location and its poverty  it has succeeded  with a few brief interruptions  in maintaining its independence. In 1631 its independence was recognized by the papacy.
67,What is the best riddle that you know?,"If you were standing in front of a door  one leading to heaven and one leading to hell  neither of which are labeled  and guarding that door is a guard  one who always lies and one who always tells the truth  but you don't know who's who  what question would you ask to definitively know which one is the door to heaven versus hell.answer: ""what would the other guard say that you would say is the door to heaven (hell)?"" then you know the opposite door is the door to heaven (hell)"
68,buying on the Net,"I do not think there is such a site.The question is just too genereic - you need to define what do you want to buy  and what is your criteria for defining ""best""; is it the price? customer service? user exprience of the website? return policy?I doubt if there is any site that can be considered the best in all these categories."
69,Economics of running a restaurant?,90% of restaurants fail in their first year of existence. A 10% profit level for a restaurant  is considered a success. The average revenue and net income is hard to define without knowing the food concept and what type of liquor license the establishment will have: just beer and wine license or full bar license? Will the restaurant depend heavily on take out food orders or mostly dining within? The hours are very long 12 to 15 hours a day if yo will be serving lunch and dinner.
70,How to remove tree sap from car?,I have had good luck with commercial products available at auto supply stores for just a few dollars. Below are some additional suggestions if you want to try DIY:
71,Why do gas stations mix ethanol into gas?,Right.  Fuel additives are helpful for reduction of emissions  although they are not always economical.  For the most part  the US congress has subsidized the creation of ethanol  which tends to be a net cost unless created from waste agricultural products.Another substance that has the same anti-emissions properties as ethanol is MTBE.  There has been a lot of press about MTBE recently due to its tendency to pollute groundwater.
72,Won't the concept of arranged marriage go away eventually?,Not when there are practicing pundits in the world who still believe in this practice.So long as there are practitioners  the practice will live.
73,Why is it impossible to fly faster then speed of light,"It is impossible *as far as we know*  which doesn't rule it out in the long run.  Some scientists claimed to have gotten around the limit already: http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/faster_than_c_000719.html.  Mostly  those who postulate the existence of particles that travel faster than the speed of light  also admit that it is impossible for said particles to cross the speed of light boundry.However  to explain the current rule  you can look to Einstein's theory of relativity.  There are many equations  but they basically say that as velocity approaches the speed of light  your mass would increase to infinity  your length would decrease to infinity  and time would dialate to infinity (stand still).  We cannot mathematically explain anything crossing the speed of light boundry.  To be more precise than saying ""infinity""  what actually happens is that a term in the equation becomes a complex number  causing a singularity.Traditional methods of propulsion (rocket engines  jets  ion engines  solar sails  etc) are of no use either.  This is becasue that the amount of energy necessary to increase one's velocity increases as you approach the speed of light.  When you are very close to the speed of light  in order to speed up more  you would need vast amounts of power.  We just don't have the technology to do it that way."
74,Why we are not using the sea waves to generate electricity?,"Same reason solar power isn't more popular despite lots of sunshine: with current technology the cost per kwh is still much higher than for power generated with fossil fuels. As fossil fuel prices rise and technology improves so-called ""alternative"" energy sources become more cost effective  but the crossover point still appears to be several years in the future.Forcing expensive alternative technologies on the market before they are economically viable simply raises electricity prices for homeowners--this is part of the reason CA electric rates were so far above the national average in the 1990's  opening the door for Enron and like to make their ill-fated arbitrage plays..."
75,What voltage adapter should i use for my 5.4v pda?,Both should be OK  but you might want to go with the 5V one if you're paranoid. (Lower voltage is safer than higher.) Note that voltages tend to vary  anyway; what you get out of the wall can fluctuate rapidly. As long as it's not significantly off  you should be OK - most electronic devices are built to be fairly tolerant of electrical variances.The current does matter  but you will mostly want to be sure that the adapter has a high enough current rating. Also be sure to check the polarity. Reversed polarity is very damaging  and is probably the most likely way you could mess up your equipment.
76,Which are the best K-12 public schools in the SF Bay area?,"it depends on what you're looking for.Cupertino district has some of the best test scores  but the flavor of the classes and homework is very intense. creativity is not promoted  but instead repetitive training and exercises are encouraged. Some people find this stifling  but this district is VERY popular especially with people of asian origin.Neighboring Saratoga has similar or better scores  but the corriculum encourages much more diversity and creativity.Palo Alto has a mixture of very good and average schools  so it depends which ones you get in to. The flavor is generally similar to Saratoga  and maybe a tad less competitive.Another district to consider is Los Altos  the main problem there is that the high school is not very good.The attached URL will give you very good insight into the scores and quality of the schools as well as demographics  but unfortunately very little insight into the ""flavor"" of each."
77,How do I use the MUNI in SF?,If you're going this route regularly  then Caltrain Monthly pass holders can purchase a Muni sticker along with their pass at all Caltrain ticket offices  Ticket Vending Machines and through the Ticket-by-Mail program. The Muni sticker isn’t available with the 10-ride Ticket. The Muni sticker allows Caltrain passholders unlimited rides on all Muni services  except cable cars  for a monthly cost of $40  a $5 discount off the cost of a Muni Fast Pass.If you're just looking for something for the day  then I would say take CalTrain from Palo Alto to the City and then get a 1 day Muni Passport ($9)
78,Why live in 'hurricane' place Florida?,Through my personal experience with people who live in Florida  I would say that the following factors might be core drivers:- One has grown up in Florida; it has always been home- One is from the Carribbean  South America or Latin America  wants to emigrate to the US and is attracted to the large Latin/Carribbean population in some parts of Florida. Or perhaps has a friend  realative  etc. who has moved there.- One is from the Eastern part of the US  where Florida is the closest hot beach destination. This is extremely attractive after four months of snowy winter.- One is retired or planning to retire. Florida has long been a popular new home among retirees  particularly those who have lived in the Eastern part of the US (see above). The large retirement population makes it easy for retirees to find services and community that attracts people like them.- One went to school there and has lived there long enough to make enough of a life there (friends  acquaintances  familiarity) to not want to leave- One gets a job in Florida  or wants to live near things found only in Florida  such as Disney World  the Everglades  Key West  etc.
79,How do I remove candle wax from a polar fleece jacket?,I've heard the best thing to do is to try to pull off as much as you can then put a paper towel over the area and run an iron over it. Repeat with new paper towels until the wax is gone.

81,How do male penguins survive without eating for four months?,Male penguins don't eat for 60 days. The female comes back after 2 months  and the male goes to feed again.During the incubation period  the male's one and only job is to keep the egg warm. So he conserves energy by not moving at all. They just huddle. During this time he can lose up to 1/3 to 1/2 of his body weight.
82,Are things mentioned about Leonardo in Da Vinci Code true?,"Some histroy is ""true""  but some are just come out from imagination."
83,Why doesn't the NBA implement a minor leagues?,The NBA does have minor leagues - they're called the CBA  and the International leagues. :)Seriously - because viewers seem to value explosiveness over efficiency  I think we're seeing a major shift in the average age of NBA players towards young athletes that are quicker  high-flying and more resilient to injury. I wouldn't be surprised at all if by the end of this decade the average age of the league allstars is well under 25.
84,Why don't European restaurants serve water?,There's a general belief in Europe (and in fact elsewhere in the world  such as China) that it's unhealthy to drink water with a meal because it dilutes the digestive juices. Wine is OK because it stimulates digestion  and mineral waters are also considered digestives.In general  Europeans are much more concerned with the digestive process than Americans.
85,What's the longest english word without a vowel in it?,The longest word without a vowel is Rhythm.It is referenced on below web site where you can find more fun facts.
86,Formula1 car,Let me break it down-Engine- 3 liter V10.  Approximately 900+ hp  19 000 rpm.  The engine weighs about 200 lbs.  It spins so fast that metal valve springs can't keep  the springs are pneumatic.Brakes- The better your brakes  the later you can brake and thus you can spend more time going fast.  These are carbon fiber and take 3 months to make.  They heat up to around 1500 F in use and can be seen glowing.  The wheels are limited to 13 inches in order to limit braking capability.  As they are  the driver experiences 4 G's of decelerating load under heavy braking.  An average person would black out in an F1 car.Aerodynamics- Surprisingly  drag is not the critical factor  downforce is.  These cars have very high coefficients of drag  due to the open wheels and spoilers.  The downforce is created by aero devices which are basically inverted aeroplane wings  which push the car to the ground under speed.  It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing  once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer  downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.Traction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning.  The governing body (the FIA) wants to make this illegal but right now it is not feasible because it is merely software in the engine management systems  and it is not feasible to decompile these systems to find illegal code.Transmisison- The cars utilize computer controlled sequential manual transmissions.  The computers manage the throttle and clutch to pull off perfect shifts in one tenth of a second.  All the driver does is pull a lever.  The clutch is only used from a standstill and is engaged from a lever on the steering wheel.What doesn't make the cars fast-Tires- The tires are grooved to limit traction.  If the drivers were allowed to run slicks  the traction and G loading would be so high that drivers would black out and possibly crash.  Starting in 2005  they also must last the entire race.Wheels- Size limited to prevent the installation of overlarge brakes which would also push the drivers beyond the limits of human physiologyBrakes- As stated earlier  size limited.  Also  no ABS at all (outlawed in 1994).

89,world smallest volcano,Taal volcano in the Philippines is considered to be the world's smallest active volcano. Its caldera is ~400 meters tall. It's also considered one of the world's most active volcanos  as it has erupted over 20 times in the past 400 years.
90,"Who decided red means ""stop"" and green means ""go""?","here is what the Net has to offer:http://signalfan.freeservers.com/history.html""As early as the mid-1800's  the railroads in both England and the United States were using lanterns  hung from crossbars  to give railroad men a signal visible by night as well as by day.  For the control or direction of street traffic by colored lights however  England appears to have led the way. The worlds first traffic signal using colored lights was installed in December of 1868 at the intersection of George and Bridge Streets near the Houses of Parliament. It had been installed in response to a suggestion by a select committee that railway signal gear be adapted to street traffic. It's purpose was to give protection to members of Parliament and lesser street crossers at a point where vehicle traffic was very heavy.The resulting signal was invented by J.P. Knight  a railroad signaling engineer. Shown here by a surviving drawing  it was to have been an imposing 22' high and crowned with a gas light. The semaphore arms  when extended horizontally  meant ""Stop"". When lowered to a droopy 45° angle  meant ""Caution"". At night  a green light and red light were used in conjunction with the arms.Although it is entirely possible and probable that other attempts were made to control traffic by colored lights after this London experience  no recorded account has come down to us until the earlier part of the 20th century..""you can also refer to:http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/2004/Projects/J0332.pdf#search='red%20is%20stop%20green%20is%20go%20history'"
91,how was Einstein's General Relativity theory proven ?,First  I would never say that a theory has been proven. There may be a lot of evidence that supports a theory  and as a result it may no longer be on the list of theories that are being challenged  but theories are always theories and should always be open to adjustment by new evidence. A good theory is just a collection of hypothesis  experiments and deductions that survives repeated challenge and can therefore be used to predict untested outcomes.Now to your question (sorry for the tangent)... I think that most physicists consider Arthur Eddington's observations of the bending of light during the 1919 solar eclipse as the first solid evidence to support Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Einstein's theory predicted that gravitational fields would bend light  and Eddington's measurements supported that prediction  thus making it the first empirical data to support the theory.
92,Can someone tell me what happened in Buffy's series finale?,The gang makes an attack on the First's army  aided by Willow  who performs a powerful spell to imbue all of the Potentials with Slayer powers. Meanwhile  wearing the amulet that Angel brought  Spike becomes the decisive factor in the victory  and Sunnydale is eradicated. Buffy and the gang look back on what's left of Sunnydale  deciding what to do next...--but more importantly  there will no longer be any slaying in Sunnydale  or is that Sunnyvale....
93,Why hybrid cars gas mileage is better in city ?,hybrid cars save energy in two ways:1.by storing energy from the breaks2.by engaging the gas motor only in it's most effective work RPM meaning that the system will engage the gas motor mostly at coursing speed (close to the most efficient motor RPM)Having said the above  driving in the city almost never gets you to the efficient RPM.Also- it is true that the same energy that is being stored in the cars' battery needed to be generated by chemic energy. The cool thing about it is that the pollution can be outside of the city and not in the city. (Like in San Francisco  the electric buses generate the same pollution as a gas buses it is just not in the city.You can also add that electric engines are much quieter then gas engines.So- all in all- I the hybrid benefits are more visible in city driving
94,Isn't Non-Violence and Non-Cooperation more effective than War?,Not to be a punk  but it really depends on what you mean by non-violence  non-cooperation  and effective. As many people have noted  we've been non-violent and non-cooperative with Cuba and North Korea for many years  and that hasn't been particularly effective. Which doesn't mean war is the answer. Just means non-cooperation and effective can mean a lot of things.
95,Good ways to fight an ant invasion,First of all- I hate ants. I have long history of ant-hatred.  And I had problems with our house earlier this year.  We use Grant's Ant Stakes  and setup a perimeter defense strategy.  Completely encircle the house with these things  3 feet or so apart  and create 2 circles  inner circle and outer circle around the house.btw - because this is outside the house  you don't have to worry about poison as much.

98,how does a helicopter fly,A helicopter gets its power from rotors or blades. When its rotors are spinning  a helicopter doesn't look much like an airplane. But the rotor blades have an airfoil shape like the wings of an airplane. So as the rotors turn  air flows more quickly over the tops of the blades than it does below. This creates enough lift for flight.

100,How come fire trucks are red?,Firetrucks are painted to be easily visible for safety reasons.  Not all firetrucks are red and the decision on color is made at a local level. Many cities are beginning to use a bright yellow-lime color instead of red. Studies have shown that this is much more visible to a wide variety of people. Going to a fashionable  but not functional color like like black or gray would never happen for safety reasons.
101,A baby's eyes,I would think that this occurs because the brain and sensory system develops into its full capabilities very early in life so that an infant can use their senses as soon as possible for learning  communication&protection. Thus the eyes grow to near full size well before the rest of an infant's body  and look bigger in proportion.
102,How effective is massage in relieving stress?,Massage is good for relieving stress if you find the right kind of you.One of the most popular massages is Swedish massage. Light to medium pressure is applied with long  soothing strokes. Sometimes stress can cause muscle pain. Deep tissue massage can be tailored to the person's need. Aromatherapy massage makes use of the therapeutic effect of essential oil combined with a relaxing massage. Warm stone massage has become very popular in the past few years. Reflexology is a special form of foot massage.It may take a few trials to find the right kind of massage for you. Once you find it  it can help maintain good physical health and stress reduction.

105,Capturing light in a container,So the answer to your specific question is 'no'.  The problem is that if the container shines  it means that light and energy is being lost and will eventually run out.  There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes  but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.Some radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.Now  to get more generalized... it is possible to trap light in a container that doesn't shine. Scientists have been able to free light in its place using supercooled clouds of sodium which are naturally opaque  but can temporarily transmit light when altered via a laser beam.  If the laser is shut off  a light beam that is passing through the cloud will be temporarily frozen in place.  Australian scientists have recently been able to extend this interaction to be nearly as long as a second.Once the laser is reintroduced the beam is recovered and continues on its way.  Now all this is a little debatable  since the photons actually get temporarily swallowed up by the material.  The photons that come out afterwards have the same configuration and quantum state as what went in  but whether they are exactly the same photons is more of a question for philosophy than for physics.
106,Can someone give me background on William Shattner?,"Well  first of all it's ""Shatner""  not ""Shattner"".His career highlights include:""Star Trek"" the TV series and subsequent movie franchise (playing Captain James T.

107,Why do some DVDs freeze up during playback?,I believe this is a problem with the DVD player. I've had this problem and the frequency of it occurring differs by player. For example  I rarely have this problem replaying a DVD on my computer.  But its happened to me several times with my player attached to my TV  although I've had several players.
108,When will Google buy Yahoo?,Their respective market caps are too close for this to ever happen.Interestingly  many reporters  analysts and tech pundits that I talk to think that the supposed competition between Google and Yahoo is fallacious  and that they are very different companies with very different strategies. Google's true competitor is often seen as being Microsoft  not Yahoo. This would support your claim that they are complementary.
109,Do animals have feelings?,It's clear that humans and animals (especially those close to us in the evolutionary tree)  share similar chemical responses in their brain when faced with highly emotional situations.  Whether it be fear  contentment  mating urges  we have a lot of analogous mechanisms going on.  On this basis alone  there is a pretty strong argument that animals have feelings.One possible counter-argument  however  is based on the definition that for certain chemical responses to be called feelings  that the being in question needs to have a conscious awareness of their state.  With this defition  it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.My opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious  as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals.If the neurochemical basis for consciousness is ever discovered we'll be able to quickly check which animals have this  and I suspect we'll find that many are conscious.  If this is so  then their feelings will be as real as human ones in all senses.
110,What are the tradeoffs in automotive intake manifold design?,Longer runners are better for high rpm power but you sacrifice power at the low end.  Shorter runners give you more grunt at low rpm's but are less efficient at high rpm's.  Many modern vehicles have variable intake runners to switch between short and long paths based on rpm.  In the reference below  a white paper on Toyota's TVIS variable induction system (10-15 years old but you'll get the gist of it)
111,Is Trigonometry considered high school or college level math?,"In the US  Trig is normally considered as a high school level course  however  it is not a required course to graduate. I believe Algebra is the highest of the high school math courses that are required for graduation  although some schools may still only require Geometry.In the US the typical sequence for math courses is Pre-Algebra  Geometry  Algebra  Trigonometry and then Calculus (which is usually taken at the high school level as Pre-Calculus  but may also be taken as full ""AP"" Calculus  where the ""AP"" stands for ""Advanced Placement"" and means that the student can get University-level credit for that course when they go to College)."
112,Why is there often a mirror in an elevator?,"The purpose is functional  but it's psychological rather than mechanical.Here's an explanation  from: http://www.slyasafox.com/book/book_33.html""In the early industrial age  buildings began to spring up all over the east coast. Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. As buildings got taller and taller  more people began to use elevators. Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were.Elevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer  but at the time it was very expensive to do so. Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator  and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. They may have had a different name for the approach  but they were using the fundamentals of the �est problem statement tool. One engineer said  I think our elevator speeds are just fine  people are crazy.Then an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. He proposed that the problem was people think elevators move to slow. He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. Instead of concentrating on larger motors  slicker pulley designs and such  they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator.When they looked at the problem from this angle  the ideas started to snowball. Is it really too slow? Why do they think it is slow? How can we distract them? How can we make it more comfortable? Are customers scared of heights?This lead to some first hand customer research. They found that a lot of people thought the elevators were a lot slower then they actually were.They also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator  being suspended in the air  and preoccupied with the fear of falling.t room for additional equipment of any sort  so they brainstormed on that. This lead to the idea of mirrors in elevators so people would think about something else besides danger. Was their hair combed properly? Did her makeup look okay?By installing mirrors in the elevators  people became distracted and were no longer preoccupied with the fear of falling. On a follow up survey  customers commented how much faster the new elevators were even though the speed was exactly the same. The elevator design itself had not changed at all."""
113,what to buy for a baby shower,"Sometimes  people who are expecting children register at baby stores  just like they do for weddings. So you can check with the host/hostess of the baby shower and find out if the expecting mother registered at Babys R Us or Gap Kids or some other baby store. Registry gifts are easy because you know you're not buying a duplicate and that you're getting the mom something she really wants and will need.If there is no registry  you might ask the person hosting the shower for ideas. Often the host or hostess is very close to the expecting mother  and will have ""inside information"" about what she wants or already has.If these fail  you have two options with which you can't go wrong: cute outfits or practical accesories. Cute outfits for newborn-sized children are great for the show-off ""ooh-ahh"" factor during the baby shower  as well as serving the long-term utilitarian puropse of clothing the baby. Practical gifts will probably attract less attention at the shower  but will be infintely helpful to parents later. Parents can never have too many baby washcloths  bibs  onesies  and newborn socks. I wouldn't suggest buying anything that comes in many different models  such as bottles or high chairs  though  because parents-to-be often have very specific requirements for these types of items and it's easy to incorrectly guess at their desires."

117,Why can Bush get away with misinforming us about intelligence  then use that as reason for war?,"Because the American public is more willing to forgive presidents that don't project themselves as smarter then them.  Its similar to how Oliver North and the Irancontra scandal in the 80's did not affect Reagan's popularity  but how Clinton's ""lies"" about Monica almost resulted in impeachment.  In a way  this may be Bush's genius  that he understands what lies Americans are willing to accept  and not accept."

125,What causes air turbulence while flying?,Turbulences are mostly caused by wind shear and pressure differencesPilots don't really know when they are going to encounter turbulences. But they can have a good estimation about it from several inputs:1.	Before any flight a pilot will call the FAA briefing center and will get a detailed weather forecast along his route.a.	Within that briefing you get all the estimated turbulences with an up-to-date other pilot reports.b.	You will also be notify on the altitude  direction  and location of the jet stream which is a major cause of turbulencesc.	A bad weather activity is  of course  also a major cause- cumulonimbus (active storm clouds)  thunder storms  hurricanes etc will not come without turbulences in there close environment2.	By looking out side  sometimes you can spot indications of wind shear such as- differences in the type of clouds.3.	many airplanes carry a weather radar to track bad weather activityTo sum it up- Pilot cannot tell the exact location and the severity of the turbulences along his route. But he can build a good forecast/estimated picture of the air activity of it. This is exactly the reason why they ask you to fasten your seatbelt whenever you are seated even if the fasten seatbelt sign is turned off- there are always surprises along the way.BTW- the FAA brief center number is:1-800-WX-BRIEF

130,How do I get rid of my California ant problem?,In a similar situation  after trying everything  I finally broke down and called the professionals.  Their approach was different than anything I could do myself with off-the-shelf pest control supplies.Basically  they approached the problem in two ways.  Exterior spraying around the foundation and in-the-wall spraying.  Since our kids were young at the time  I didn't want lots of chemicals being sprayed everywhere and I really didn't want a bunch of spraying in the house.  Their approach kept all of the chemicals out of the common areas and left no dangerous ant traps hanging around.The exterior spraying is pretty much what you expect  guys with sprayers working the foundation of the house.  The interior spraying was nice  because they just took off light and electrical plates and sprayed down into the walls.All-in-all  it made a huge difference for us.  While it might require a couple applications up front to get started (it took two for us)  once they got it under control it worked well for the rest of the season.
131,How do I take my money out of 401k without penalty?,You can withdraw the money for childrens higher education. Details:Higher education expenses.   Even if you are under age 59½  if you paid expenses for higher education during the year  part (or all) of any distribution may not be subject to the 10% additional tax. The part not subject to the tax is generally the amount that is not more than the qualified higher education expenses (defined later) for the year for education furnished at an eligible educational institution (defined later). The education must be for you  your spouse  or the children or grandchildren of you or your spouse.
132,Value of landscaping?,"The info I've been given differs somewhat from the previous answer... I've heard that for a normal neighborhood home it's hard to get your money back on landscaping because most people believe that they can do it themselves. I.e.  once you get past the basic ""curb appeal"" (meaning it looks ""nice"" and not like a war zone)  any money you put in will be hard to get back out."

134,Why do my chocolate chip cookies always turn out flat?,1) Don't over-mix the dough.2) Be sure to use cold butter. It takes more work when mixing  but I that should help.3) Try letting the cookie sheet cool off between batches too - running cold tap water over it helps.4) If all else fails  try using shortening instead of butter. (And don't use margarine  either.)
135,Can I copy a copy-protected CD to my MP3 player?,Yes  but you won't like the answer.  Basically you have to get a sound card that has a digital S/PDIF input and an audio cd player that has a digital output.  Then you can grab the digital output by playing the cd and recording the output.  You'll have to manually separate the tracks but in theory the sound quality would be exactly the same as ripping the CD.

141,R rated movies on air plane rides,"Most international airlines have atleast 1 or 2 pg-13/R rated movies. But this is out of a possible 30 odd channels (including audio music).It's not too bad a ratio.But these airlines have ""personal screens"".Airlines do publish movie schedule upfront (1 month in advance usually).  Not the same movies are shown in all the routes that  that particular airline flies.The problem you are referring to is completely due to lack of personal screens. It's not so bad when you have personal screens as kids have a few channels dedicated for themselves (cartoons  children's movie  sports channel  comedy channel  etc.)Cathay Pacific  Singapore Airlines  Lufthansa  etc. have personal screens which is very convenient."
142,retrofit versus new windows?,"I went the window retrofit route based on a recommendation from a friend.  So far  after ~4 years all is well.  No leaks  no problems. I was reluctant to redo stucco around the house and concerned the results wouldn't look good.A few things to consider.  First  retrofit windows look different  since they have a wider border and mount within the existing legacy frames.  It's a matter of personal taste  but I think the wider borders actually look nice.Other factors to consider are the window frame color and vinyl vs. aluminum.  Our house originally had brown trimmed windows  since a previous owner had already retrofitted some windows.  We decided to stick with the same color trim.  The issue is that the colored ones only come in aluminum.  I think this is because they are actually anodized for the coloring. I've heard vinyl has better insulation properties and had we not already had some windows complete  white vinyl would've been my choice.Hopefully you are getting doubled paned windows  if not I'd highly recommend it. Check out the wndows to see if they use argon between the panes.  This seems to be the gas of choice  since inert gasses provide the best insulation characteristics.Lastly  check out the ""low-e"" or low-emissivity glass.  Basically this is a coating on the glass that reflects long wave infra-red radiation for better heat/cold management. Cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter."

152,How long does take a space craft to get from the Earth to the Moon?,It depends on what you are sending.  The Apollo missions were the last set of *manned* missions to the moon  and here is the travel time:Launched: 16 July 1969 UT 13:32:00 (09:32:00 a.m. EDT)Landed on Moon: 20 July 1969 UT 20:17:40 (04:17:40 p.m. EDT)It took about 4 days to get there.  Rocket technology has not change too much since then so you can expect that getting people to the moon at this point would take about the same amount of time.If you are dealing with a non-human payload  you may be able to cut down time  both because it is likely lighter  and because you don't need to worry as much about damaging G-forces.I've included a link that has the history of all missions to the moon  manned and unmanned.
153,Antioxidants in Cocoa?,Cornell University study found that cocoa has up to 3 times the antioxidants of those in green tea  and twice red wine.The reason that cocoa leads the other drinks is its high content of compounds called phenolic phytochemicals  or flavonoids  indicating the presence of known antioxidants that can stave off cancer  heart disease and other ailments. However  the health benefits are still controversial because of the saturated fats present in chocolate.
154,Reset root password in Linux,"Here's how to do it.I would have had to dig up the CD's (who knows where they are) and do a recovery that way  or download something from Tom's Root and Boot Site. I had access to the Grub loader  so I had it easy.If you've lost your root password  you might be able to recover it this way. However  some systems are protected with boot loader passwords that won't let you do that without THAT password. If the boot loader is password protected  you need to boot from other media - for newer systems  the install CD probably has the recovery tools for that (""linux rescue"" for example).But let's try it the easy way first. The first thing to try is to boot to single user mode. This MIGHT not work for you  because your system might be configured to still ask for a root password to get to single user mode. If that's the case  we'll use another trick that replaces init with /bin/bash.First  try single user. If you don't see either a LILO or GRUB boot screen  try hitting CTRL-X to get one. If it's LILO  just type ""linux single"" and that should do it (assuming that ""linux"" is the lilo label). If GRUB  hit 'e""  then select the ""kernel"" line  hit ""e"" again  and add "" single"" (or just "" 1"") to the end of the line. Press ENTER  and then ""b"" to boot. (More modern grub uses ""a"" to append to the boot line)You should get a fairly normal looking boot sequence except that it terminates a little early at a bash prompt. If you get a ""Give root password for system maintenance""  this isn't going to work  so see the ""init"" version below.If you do get the prompt  the / filesystem may not be mounted rw (although ""mount"" may say it is). Domount -o remount rw /If that doesn't work (it might not)  just type ""mount"" to find out where ""/"" is mounted. Let's say it is on /dev/sda2. You'd then type:mount -o remount rw /dev/sda2If you can do this  just type ""passwd"" once you are in and change it to whatever you like. Or just edit /etc/shadow to remove the password field: move to just beyond the first "":"" and remove everything up to the next "":"". With vi  that would be ""/:"" to move to the first "":""  space bar once  then ""d/:"" and ENTER. You'll get a warning about changing a read-only file; that's normal. Before you do this  /etc/shadow might look like:root:$1$8NFmV6tr$rT.INHxDBWn1VvU5gjGzi/:12209:0:99999:7:-1:-1:1074970543bin:*:12187:0:99999:7:::daemon:*:12187:0:99999:7:::adm:*:12187:0:99999:7:::and after  the first few lines should be:root::12209:0:99999:7:-1:-1:1074970543bin:*:12187:0:99999:7:::daemon:*:12187:0:99999:7:::adm:*:12187:0:99999:7:::You'll need to force the write: with vi  "":wq!"". (If that still doesn't work  you needed to do the -o remount rw  see above).Another trick is to add ""init=/bin/bash"" (LILO ""linux init=/bin/bash"" or add it to the Grub ""kernel"" line). This will dump you to a bash prompt much earlier than single user mode  and a lot less has been initialized  mounted  etc. You'll definitely need the ""-o remount rw"" here. Also note that other filesystems aren't mounted at all  so you may need to mount them manually if you need them. Look in /etc/fstab for the device names.Keep this in mind if you have a Linux machine in a publically accessible place : without more protection  it's not usually hard to recover a lost root password  which means it's just as easy for someone to CHANGE it  or access root without your knowlege.Another way to do this is to remove the password from /etc/shadow. Just in case you screw up  I'd copy it somewhere safe first. You wan"
155,How to handle a 1.5 year old when hitting?,"you're on the right track in understanding that he's frustrated. my viewpoint is that the frustration really comes about in not being able to communicate what he wants to person being hit. the hitting action then becomes his only recourse because he sees that it gets your attention.something my daughter's preschool does is a time-with versus a time-out and i found better results with my 3 year old. the first thing discussed is having her empathize with the other person by going beyong the ""hitting hurts"" and asking her ""how do you think hitting makes her feel?"" the second thing we do is get her to communicate her frustration is words rather than action  helping her along the way with getting the words right."

158,is it ok to replace a 1.8 liter engine with a 3.0 liter on that same car?,1. Physical compatibility- does the new engine work with the existing transmission?  If not  is a transmission available that will fit the chassis?  Does the increased weight of the engine require a new set of springs and shocks up front so as not to upset the handling balance?2.  Electrical compatibility- does the stock wiring harness and ECU work?  If not  how much work to rip out the harness and put in a compatible one.  Is a compatible harness available or does it need to be custom made (often this is a bigger obstacle than 1.)3.  Durability.  If there is a 3.0L version of the car that you currently own  does it have different components to withstand the stress of the extra power?  Specifically universal joints  driveshafts  and brakes.Often it is easier and cheaper to sell your car and buy the 3.0L version of the car you own.
159,For colIege admission  is it better to take AP classes and get Bs or easy classes and get As?,I used to work in a college admissions office for a major university and they used a specific formula for calculating GPAs. They did this to put everyone on an even playing field - so that high schools that don't weight AP classes differently would be measured the same as those that do. Though I don't remember the specific calculation anymore  I definitely remember that AP classes were given a higher score. I'd suggest you take the AP class and try for the best grade you can get - because ultimately it'll be weighted higher at the college/university you are interested in  giving you a better chance of getting in!
160,Any suggestions on hotels or B&B's in Carmel?,The best high end hotels are Post Ranch Inn and the Ventana Inn  just south of Carmel.  The Lodge at Pebble Beach and the Inn at Spanish Bay are also luxurious hotels near Carmel. The Highlands Inn in Carmel is more reasonably priced but less romantic/intimate.  The Tickle Pink Inn is even more moderately priced and has great views

163,"Is it ok to put regular gas into a car that ""requires"" premium gas?",While it is true that putting premium gas in a car designed for regular is a waste of money  the opposite is not true.  Contrary to popular belief  premium gas has the same or even less energy than regular  the sole difference being the temperature at which it will ignite.Many cars that require premium gas require it because their engines run at high temperatures and/or compression and regular gas will ignite prematurely causing detonation  which sounds like a knocking in the engine. Modern cars do have sensors which detect this condition and will dial back the power accordingly to prevent damage but the point is that the condition has to occur for the engine to respond.In effect  a tiny amount of damage can occur every time to fill your car with regular gas.  While putting regular in by accident once in a while is probably fine  the effect of the damage is cumulative and probably not worth the couple hundred you save every year.  If you have a turbocharged car then you should NEVER put in regular gas.  Ever.  The same is true for high revving  high output Honda VTEC engines like the S2000 or Prelude.PS- Cartalk also advised some listeners that the interior of their Honda Element was washable with a hose.  Some poor listener did this and inflicted hundreds of dollars in damage to their car by soaking electronic components.  Let the listener beware...

166,How do I get a sticker off of a car window  (plastic part)?  Nail polish remover seems risky?,Goo Gone is a fantastic product (available at Target and most any hardware store or drug store) and works amazingly well on even pesky sticker residue.  Soak the area  and wipe it away.  It might take repeated applications  but you can remove the sticker without scratching  and without leaving a gooey residue.Note that Goo Gone can affect some surfaces  including some plastics  so you should be careful  especially if it is clear plastic.  I've used Goo Gone many times on plastic glassic and CD cases  so it will certainly work on many plastics  but you should be careful.In the event that Goo Gone seems too risky  you can frequently remove just the adhesive residue using plain old Scotch tape.  Remove as much of the sticker as possible (the paper/plastic backing) and then apply tape to the sticker residue firmly.  Pull the tape off sharply  and some of the residue will come with it.  This is a slow process so only do it if the area is relatively small  however  I frequently use this tactic for price tags and the like and it is surprisingly effective.
167,What is the altitude that the satellite is placed so they will stay on that same altitude?,Seems like your link answers your question... Perhaps you're looking for a more general equation than the one for geosynchronous orbits? If so  then the altitude depends on the velocity of the satellite. If a satellite is moving fast enough  it can hold any altitude. The general equation to calculate altitude is r^3 = (T^2)*G*M/4(pi^2) - where G*M is the gravitational constant times the mass (M) of the body being orbited  anf T is the orbital period  which is the time it takes the satellite to fully orbit the body being orbited. The included link gives values for G*M for the various bodies in our solar system.
168,How much caffeine is in green tea?,Per Serving -Coffee　40mgGreen Tea　　　150mgBlack Tea　　　50～60mgCoke　40～60mgCocoa　　10～20mgBut - as you may know  there are a lot of different kinds of green tea  and the caffeine content differs by tea leaf type  as well as drying method.  So tea from roasted rice  is of lesser caffeine content than coffee.Also - caffeine in green tea is supposedly a better caffeine than the one in coffee.If you read Japanese --玉露；2.90-4.04%、煎茶；2.77-3.49%、番茶；2.02%、ほうじ茶；1.93%、抹茶；5.38-6.36%、白茶；4.02%、黄茶；4.01%、ウーロン茶；2.34%、プアール茶；1.31-3.4%
169,Do all professional athletes do steroids now?,I would say a good majority are  but the question is whether the steroid is considered a performance enhancing steroid or not. Andro was legal while Mark McGuire was using it  but subsequently banned. BALCO was reported to manufacture steroids that are desgined to avoid being detected during testing.
170,"How can I do a ""Like"" or ""Contains"" condition in Excel?","Your best bet is to use an IF statement.  And IF statement returns one value if a condition you specify evaluates to TRUE and another value if it evaluates to FALSE.

172,If my high school grades are so-so  should I go to community college before a 4 year college?,Most state universities will have transfer agreements with local community colleges  so spending all four years in one place is not a prerequisite to earning your diploma there. Additionally  you may find that getting into general ed classes at some state universities is quite difficult  while the equivalent courses at a community college are plentiful and offered at more convenient times.I know many people who have saved a lot of money and have been quite successful spending a couple of years in community college and then transferring to a four-year university. Good luck  whatever you decide!
173,Should I buy an electric mower or a gas powered mower?,Depends on the size of the yard and the type of mower you can by.  Honda (the vaunted HR215 series) makes the best gas mowers by far  and electrics are to be avoided unless you can get a high end cordless one.  We have a husqvarna rechargable mower which works great but is impossible to find now.  It failed in the marketplace due to its extreme cost  but it is a great electric mower.  For a medium to small yard it is great.In terms of pollution  it's hard to derive based on the numerous methods of electricity generation used in this country.  Honda mowers are cleaner than most  however.
174,How do you know if you're in love?,In my experience you just know. It's a long term feeling of always wanting to share each new experience with the other person in order to make them happy  to laugh or to know what they think about it. It's jonesing to call even though you just got off an hour long phone call with them. It's knowing that being with them makes you a better person. It's all of the above and much more.
175,What's the best way to exchange USD for CNY?,You are best off bringing your ATM card and withdrawing money froma machine at the airport when you get there. By using the ATMs you get the wholesale banking rate for that day  which means that you will get a better exchange rate than going those exchange shops or from dealing with travellers checks. The only thing to watch for is the user fee you may get charged by the machine operator as well as your bank  but this happens even domestically. Any user fee ($1-2) will typically offset by the convenience factor in my opinion.
176,Color  Dressing&Culture,"Color is often associated with the reflection of one's mood  taste  style  especially in social gatherings.  Given this  any color worn other than white or black are going to reflect one's cheerful moods or their taste.  This is true in some asian countries.  Given this we are only left with white or black.In India  people often times wear white during funerals and deaths.  You can watch this on Television whenever a celebrity dies and people gather dressed in White.  Reason for choosing white is that it's ""BLAND"" - not cheerful  not colorful  just ""plain mood"".   In the olden days (about 50 years or back) widows used to wear white dress as well - reflective of lack of cheerful life due to loss of their husband.Seems like in USA the culture is to use Black to reflect lack of cheer  giving ""conservative"" look.So  people wear black or grey suits for interviews  where they need to project their ""conservative behavior"" as in displaying quiet  modesty  down-to-earth attitude.I also believe black might have been chosen as it absorbs all the light and doesn't reflect back any thing - thereby giving a constant lack-of-color-mood in all environments."
177,What is the best blogging website to use?,It really depends on your level of tech proficiency. If you don't know HTML  www.blogger.com is really simple to use. If you want to do a lot of customization  www.typepad.com is probably better.
178,Why do puppies sniff and how do you stop them from sniffing your guests' private parts?,That is how dogs greet each other.  Apparently the anal gland of every dog has a unique scent  and that's how they recognize each other.  Your dog sniffing the privates of your guests is the result of canine instinct and is completely normal.  The dog will not outgrow this behavior but like most behaviors  can be shaped so that your dog does not do this.To stop this  NEVER react by yelling when your dog greets people in this manner.  Believe or not  this is a reinforcing behavior since dogs generally interpret any strong response as a good one.  Next time your dog does this  make sure your guests turn around and walk away from your dog.  Dogs do not like being ignored and will generally stop behavior that results in a lack of attention.
179,what is the cause for headaches,There are several possible causes for headaches.  According to a Chiropractor friend of mine  dehydration is a major cause.  For example  too many Margaritas one night can leave you seriously dehydrated  hung over and with a headache the next day.Other causes are stress  allergies  etc. Dr. Hoffman's reference below explains some of these in detail.
180,Why didn't anyone send more buses to the Superdome earlier?,I don't have an article  but I was listening to NPR last night  and the commentator was saying the evacuation was really bungled due to an organization and communication problem. No one took charge and said  hey I'm running the show  get 2000 buses and send them down  because no one felt they were in charge. FEMA  State&local police  National Guard  all were not sure what the other guys were doing and so waited for overall direction  which never really came.

183,What is the best YMU-compatible mp3 player out there?,You should definitely check out Creative's new Zen Vision. I don't have that model (it's new)  but I have the Creative Zen Micro and like it a lot.
184,Is there really such a thing as global warming?,"It's absolutely true that our recorded experience of the Earth's weather patterns is extremely limited. It's also true that through studies of geology  tree ring signatures  ice cores  and like  we see strong evidence that the Earth has had many  many cycles of hot times and ice ages.Most scientists I've read on the subject agree that there are typical cycles and that we are likely in a cycle that is moving from cold to warmer since the last ice age. They also think that as the Earth gets warmer it typically then gets colder soon after because of evaporation  clouds  changes to winds&ocean currents  etc. Many scientists also believe that this trend does occur naturally and independenly of man. That said  many believe that we are accelerating it  and that's the big concern. They're worried that the acceleration could trigger large-scale changes more quickly than they would normally happen. And  faster changes mean that life might not have enough time to adapt.For example  there's pretty strong evidence that a ~5 degree increase in the temperature of our polar waters could seriously impact the yearly cycles of algae/plankton blooms that form the basis of the ocean food chain. If this occurs over  say  12 000 years  the algae/plankton would likely adapt and still bloom  or even move and bloom elsewhere. If it happens over  say  100 years  the algae/plankton might not be able to adapt  and the snowball effect of such a loss could cascade through the entire ocean and land-based ecologies disrupting semi-stable systems in a catastrophic way.So  the issue is not that we don't know about and expect *natural* global warming  it's that we don't know what happens if said global warming happens more quickly than it would naturally. And  as ""they"" say  what you don't know can kill ya."
185,Which are the most rated College in California?,"Best really depends on what you want.  For example  UC Berkeley is generally considered the ""best"" public university because it is the most competitive and probably has the highest number of faculty with various honors such as Nobel Prizes.  But if  for example  you're interested in veterinary medicine or oenology (science of winemaking)  UC Davis is better.  If you want a greater focus on undergraduate education  many students prefer UC Santa Cruz.In addition to the other private universities that have been mentioned (Stanford  Caltech  and USC)  there is a group of small private colleges called the Claremont consortium that is very highly rated.  It includes Pomona College  Scripps College  and Harvey Mudd College.  Each of these colleges has a special focus  but students in all of them get to share facilities and cross-register for classes."
186,How do we grow a vanilla plant?,"Growing Vanilla is non-trivial. It's an orchid vine that originated in the rainforests of southeast Mexico  so requires a consistent tropical environment to grow well. As a result  most people grow them in greenhouses where they can control the temp  shade and humidity (for example  they don't like temperatures under about 55 degrees F  so no outside growing in California).On top of the greenhouse  the pollination process as well as the harvesting&preparation are extremely time intensive. I.e.  you will need to be the ""bee"" (using a syringe) and then time the harvesting just right to get the beans before they open so the vanilla isn't lost.If you're serious about giving it a try I'd suggest that you drill around Amazon for a book on it to make sure and get all of the details just right."
187,what are gamma ray bursts?,"The source of Gamma Ray bursts is currently unknown.  They are a surprising phenomenon because gamma rays are so powerful that very few events could cause them.  They have also only been recently discovered by projects like the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory  and appear to be coming from all directions  not just in the galactic plane.This would indicate a phenomenon that has extra-galactic origins... for example  activity inside of an active galactic nuclei  or quasars.Because they happen at random intervals  abd are ephemeral (often just a few seconds)  and the ""scopes"" used to capture them are not tightly directional  we don't have any instruments currently that can figure out exactly what they are.  For now that means  the best we can do is hypothesize based on what cosmic events we believe are of the appropriate magnitude to tigger gamma rays."

189,who would you like to be superman spiderman or mightymouse?,"MM has always been a god to me! First  he's the only major superhero with artistic talent (singing). Second  while Superman and Spidey are your typical privileged middle-class white male superheroes  MM has risen above the persecution heaped on his mouse ethnicity by cats  humans  elephants  and other species to gain equal status in the superhero pantheon. Third  his super feats are all the more impressive given that he is mouse  not man. And lastly  he is the only superhero to have a namesake computer peripheral.""HERE I COME TO SAVE THE DAY!"" ...doesn't that just say it all  superhero-wise?"
190,Can you make a day trip out of visiting the Hoover Dam from Las Vegas? Anything else to do there,You can go to Lake Mead Recreation Park along with the Hoover dam.You can also have a 5 hour ride and go to the Grand Canyon  but if you are planning on getting back to Las Vegas on the same day then it makes it a very long day.  There are bus tours that take you to the Grand Canyon  so you don’t really have to drive
191,Why's watching Television so addictive?,I'd say that TV is more popular than books because it is multimedia and much more closely matches how we normally take in information. TV is video and audio. You can see and hear it and thus more information can be squeezed into a short amount of time while also giving a much richer experience. Next time you're watching TV  consider how much you would have to write just to completely describe a single frame.Last  TV is also much easier because it's a passive medium. Reading requires your brain to work harder to both read the words and then interpret them into visuals. TV is already visual and can be watched with much less focus&energy.
192,What is the origin of the name 'Soccer'?,"In the early days of this game  an association was set up in England to codify the rules.  The game was sometimes referred to as ""association football "" probably to distinguish it from other variations.  ""association"" was abbreviated to ""assoc. "" so the game was nicknamed ""soccer.""Since the term ""football"" was already used in the U.S. to describe a different game  the name ""soccer"" stuck here."
193,What's the capital city of Bolivia?,Sucre is the legal capital  though the government sits in La Paz
194,Why is it so foggy in San Francisco?,"It isn't as foggy as you might think. Spring and Fall are quite temperate  and San Francisco is renowned for it's ""Indian Summer"" in September. However  Mark Twain had a point when he said ""The coldest Winter I ever spent was Summer in San Francisco.""This is because the warm air from inland (where it gets quite hot in the Summer) clashes with the cold air from the surrounding Pacific Ocean and the SF Bay. When that happens  fog forms. Further explanation from http://kids.earth.nasa.gov: ""At night  the ground surface cools by radiating heat to space. Air near the ground cools to the dew point temperature  causing water in the air to condense.""Sure it's cold  but fog can be quite beautiful and atmospheric. Just look at the pictures on http://www.goldengatephoto.com/sanfran/thefogrollsin.html  Lovely!"
195,Why does it seem that most of the diets don't work on over weight people?,I think that the main reason is that obese people should be treated as drug addict. The main problem is that both obese and drug addicts have habits that causing them to either eat or do drug. Both of them also have physical addiction that needed to be treated accordingly. Only after facing those two major factors it will be the time for diets.Another major issue is that the society actually unknowingly supports obesity; let me give you an example- today in the US  an obese person can claim disability and get welfare. By that  the government actually encourages obesity. Why would someone even try to get better?Authorities should condition those allowances: if you lose weight over a specified period you will continue getting it. If you did not lose weight you lose the allowance.We should always keep in mind that obesity costs a lot more then just the allowance that the obese person gets. There is the health costs  taxes lost and so on.I say- do what you can to leave healthy life  and don’t give up
196,Is it true that there are no longer cheap buffets in Vegas hotels like in the old days?,Yes  it is true that buffets are not cheap anymore. The primary reason for that is the standard and cost of living in LV has gone up. It's probably one of the fastest growing (grown) cities in recent months. Real Estate prices have more than doubled - tripled almost in some cases.
197,Which car and house insurance company is recommended in California?,Costco gives some of the best rates.The service is very good  too. There was this time when I couldn't start my car. Since it's a certain European car  it couldn't be jumpstarted by a friend's car. Only a tow truck had enough power to jumpstart it. I called the Costco auto assitance. Not only did they send a tow truck quickly  but they also called to follow up on whether the problem was fixed or not. Highly recommend it!

200,Best gifts to bring back from San Francisco?,I would go to the SF Ferry Building and pick from the fantastic selection of shops/goodies there...in particular  some chocolate from Scharffenberger or Michael Recchuiti (both bay area natives and expert chocolatiers)--you can easily find stuff for under $40.If you go on a Saturday morning  I'd go to the the Farmer's Market (which is in back of the Ferry Building) and pick up some June Taylor preserves  which are beautifully packaged  seasonal and delicious. Each jar is about $11.
201,How come the usage of alternate power generators is not more prevalent in a state like Californi,California electricity is generated by several sources  including hydroelectric  wind  geothermal and nuclear (in addition to the more traditional natural gas).  The question is why these other sources aren't used more  and the answer is that historically  they've either been more expensive or have environmental risks of their own (esp. for nuclear).  As petroleum and natural gas sources start to get used up  and world demand for energy increases  the cost of electricity from natural gas will go up and the other sources will become more cost effective and more prevalent.Incidentally  solar power is another source used in California  but it's provided by individuals  not power companies.  If your house has solar power and you have the right equipment  you can sell your surplus electricity to the power company and your electric meter will literally run backward.
202,who wins the hand if 2 players make the same high card flush?,When comparing two flushes  the highest card determines which is higher. If the highest cards are equal then the second highest card is compared; if those are equal too  then the third highest card  and so on. The player holding the Jh should win your hand.
203,Is there any way to reconcile karma with free will?,"I don't think they need to be reconciled. Karma is all about free will :)From the basic definition on Wikipedia:""Karma is a concept of eastern religions about the entire cycle of cause and effect. Simply explained  it is a sum of all that an individual has once done during many lives and is currently doing. The effects of those deeds actively create present and future experiences  thus making one responsible for one's own life."""

206,"Why do all zippers have ""YKK"" on them?",ykk is a big manufacturer of zippers
207,When do you use a semicolon instead of a colon?,"While historically the use of the semicolon and colon were similar  modern usage seems to be diverging  with semicolons indicating breaks slightly stronger than commas and colons introducing lists and explanations.Semicolons have always been used in a manner very similar to commas  but with greater ""weight.""  That is  the semicolon introduces greater breaks in the sentence  dividing clauses which are longer and more independent  while commas are reserved for short pauses and for separating lists of short items.Continuing up the continuum  colons are ""weightier"" than semicolons  but less so than periods.  They introduce a break which is longer or more important than that introduced by semicolons  but not as final as periods.  Colons separate clauses which can stand as independent sentences grammatically  while semicolons can also be used for non-sentential clauses.However  in modern writing the colon is rarely used in this role as glorified semicolon.  The colon has developed a specific semantics as a break separating an introduction from an explanation.  For example  the colon is used after the salutation in formal letters.  It is used to introduce quotes  separating the source from the quoted text.  A colon is used to introduce a list  included bulleted lists.  A colon is used to separate the parts in a multipart title  such as ""Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books"" or ""Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't""."

209,Why do people amputate dogs tail?,"There are a couple of reasons why this was done a few decades ago.  Dogs with curved tails are known to be chasing flies and fleas that got on their tails. Owners of the dogs found this a nuisance that all of a sudden a dog would keep chasing its tail for several hours in a week. Due to this dogs forgot their ""job"" which was to guard sheep  or pull carts  etc.Secondly  certain dogs go very wild if we pull their tails  even if its done playfully. They simply get mad at you  bite you or even kill you  if you are small.  Since little children always found it playful to pull the tails of the dogs and this meant a potential danger to their lives  the owners cut their tails short.Ever thought of the word CUR-TAIL? :-)"
210,Is Finland a part of Scandinavian countries?,"I remember asking this question when traveling through the region. I was told that ""Scandinavia"" is Norway  Denmark&Sweden  but not Finland (which as you point out has a drastically different language and is related to Hungarian).That said  ""Nordics"" are people from Norway  Denmark  Sweden  Finland and Iceland as they all have Viking heritage and/or were under Viking rule long enough that their cultures are very similar. People from Greenland are also sometimes lumped into this group."
211,How come stars are generally round?,Largely because of the massive amounts of gravitational force involved.  A sphere is the only sustainable shape when talking about forces of that magnitude.

213,do i need to bring a gift for a 1 year anniversary party?,"According to the manners mavens  you shouldn't bring a gift in this cirucumstance because it embarasses other guests who didn't bring a gift.  However  it's my personal opinion is that as a guest it's always good idea to make a small gesture like bringing flowers or a bottle of wine.According to Miss Manners:""Bringing presents to parties  unless they are children's birthday parties or bridal or baby showers  where opening them is part of the entertainment  is a terrible idea ""According to Amy Vanderbilt:""No presents"" means just that. Don't embarrass other guests by popping up with bows and ribbons. If you're compelled to give  drop it off or send it well before the fiesta begins."
214,Restaurant recommendations in SF Chinatown,Top floor of Empress of China is not bad  if a little pricy. The view is amazing.

215,If a baby is 1.7 month old and has no teeth  should one be worry?,If your baby has not gotten any teeth by one year (12 months)  consult your pediatrician. The entire set may not be in until he's about 3 years old or so  but he should have at least a couple at this point.
216,What's the best way to keep one language while learning a similar one?,The best way (only way?) not to forget languages is to speak them with native people for a few years.  This is possible only if you live in a cosmopolitan environment where you naturally bump into people who can speak only one of the languages that you are trying to develop and not the other ones.This is the reason why we find street vendors in countries who travel between the borders of the regions where diverse languages are spoken  to be reasonably fluent in many languages at the same time.  This is because the guy wants to make a sale and he can do it better if he can make a conversation in your native language.  He may also end up meeting folks that can speak only their tongue and nothing else and hence the vendor ends up picking up that language. For example if you happen to be travelling between Germany  Switzerland&France borders then you may end up speaking German and French and still retain both.Bottomline is you would have to speak the language with people who can understand only that language and not any other language that you know pretty well.  Then you are forced to speak it and you will surely retain it for a very long time.
217,Is paid inclusion a good way to monetize a search engine?,No I don't think so. It seems to be a better bet to come up with a system to bid on keywords  like Google&Yahoo Search Marketing (formerly Overture).  P4P is a better system than PI.

224,Why do we yawn?,Found an interesting article on this...Yawning is a unique breathing act  which is different from the usual practice of breathing. During yawning  the mouth involuntarily opens due to the spasm of mastoid muscles. These spasms  without your permission  force you to take a deep breath. It also involves many other muscles of your body  such as abdominal muscles. Lung ventilation increases  sending oxygen to the brain. Extra blood is pushed from the liver and spleen to the brain stem. During yawning  intellectual activity stops and for a moment we cannot think. We usually start yawning when we are very tired  before sleep  when we are too excited  or extremely serious.There is a yawn center in our brain that makes this act a reflex like coughing or swallowing. The yawning reflex is very contagious  forcing people to imitate it. This phenomenon even has a fancy name: alolomimea. Yawning can be easily conditioned to become a bad habit. If you fight the urge to yawn  it will return in a similar situation. Yawning is what your body develops to get a “time out” to recharge for a brief moment. It is a signal that we are running out of gas  it is a signal to rest.This is a great compensatory mechanism  without which we would drop into sleep suddenly without warning  as in patients with narcolepsy.
225,What's the biggest difference between high school&college in terms of academics?,The biggest difference is that your schedule is much more unique than it was in high school  you won't have a significant number of people with most of the same classes as you.  It is a little harder but the challenges are more about being on your own and making decisions than academics.
226,"Can you say ""peoples""?","There are times when ""peoples"" is correct and times when it is incorrect.If you are talking about individuals  then the singular is ""person"" and the plural is ""people.""  But if you are talking about whole societies  then the singular is ""people"" and the plural is ""peoples.""  Some examples of this second sense of people are ""We are a peaceful people"" (note the singular ""a"") and ""The native peoples of North America include the Inuit  Cherokee  and Hopi."""
227,Which cat has the largest variety of prey?,In Africa  a pride of lions (male: ~400 lbs  female: ~280 lbs) pretty regularly hunt wildebeest (440-600 lbs)  although they usually go after the sick or young ones.  Occasionally  they can take down a giraffe (2420-4250 lbs)  but this doesn't happen often.  Elephants (11 000 lbs) and rhinos (2500 lbs) are just a little dangerous to be bothered.In Asia  tigers can take down a water buffalo (1800-2600 lbs)  although again  they usually go for the sick or young ones.These are the cats with the largest prey.
228,How come cars in Japan are right-drive?,"Japan follows the British system of ""cars drive on the left side of the road"".""in the 1850's Gunboat diplomacy forced the Japanese to open their ports to the British and Sir Rutherford Alcock  who was Queen Victoria's man in the Japanese court  persuaded them to adopt the keep left rule.""So just as in the US where you drive on the right  and the driver's seat is on the left for maximum visibility when making a left turn  most cars in Japan have the wheel on the right.  Funny thing is  many foreign made cars in Japan (US  German  etc) keep the wheel on the left for a ""status symbol"" of hey  i'm so cool. I drive a foreign car.  But of course  now prestige is accorded to Lexus&Acura cars as well...."

231,How to grow peppers?,Peppers are easy to grow and maintain.1. Start your peppers from seed.2. Gather your containers and start planting. Fill the container with a well-draining potting soil  and sow the seeds two to a hole  water to dampen  then place the containers inside a plastic bag until they germinate. Peppers LOVE heat  so speed the germination by placing them in a warm spot. Once the sprouts have poked their way through the soil  remove the bag and place the seedlings where they can get adequate sun or artificial light  at least 8 hours a day.3. Once you have healthy  sturdy seedlings with at least 4 inches of growth  you can move them into the garden.4. Give them what they need  steadily. Be sure to fertilize with a phosphorus rich fertilizer once during initial growth  and again at pepper production time  after the blossoms have set. If the weather turns suddenly cool  cover the soil under the peppers with black plastic to help hold in the heat. Be sure to remove the plastic as temperatures increase. It's also important to water steadily  but to not OVER water peppers. An inch a week is the rule  and it should be done all at once. It helps to water at the roots  not on the leaves  as watering on the leaves can encourage disease.Click on the link below for additional info:

243,How often do I need to turn on the sprinkler during winter?,To determine how often the lawn needs water  dig around grass roots. Irrigate when the top 2 inches of soil become dry and crumbly. Water slowly and deeply  wetting the grass down to the deep root level. Frequent light sprinklings cause shallow root growth and will not result in healthy lawns. Overwatering the lawn can reduce oxygen levels to the roots  and will stifle good growth. Further  overwatering encourages some lawn weeds such as buttercups  annual blue grass  and speedwell.

246,Do artists decline in their later years?,Pete Townshend. Laurence Olivier. Kurt Vonnegut. Stevie Wonder. Truman Capote. It is sad to compare these artists' later work with the passion and excitement of their youthful art.Perhaps it has to do with Western culture's obsession with youth  but it does seem that our best artists do their greatest work when they are young and angry and fighting the establishment. Would we still hold up James Dean as an icon of cool if he had grown old enough to guest star on 'Dynasty' with his 'Giant' co-star Rock Hudson? No way.  By the same token  John Lennon will always be cooler than Paul McCartney because he was killed before he could start churning out pop fluff and become 'Sir John'.If the excesses that fuel their early creativity don't kill them prematurely  it destroys their ability to create altogether. Check out this film of Orson Welles in his later years as a pitchman for Paul Masson: http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2460093  Remember  this is the guy who made 'Citizen Kane' at 23!

Unplug the machine and flip it over so you can access the agitator brush.2. Unscrew the bottom plate that holds the brush in place  using a screwdriver.3. Lift out the brush by pulling the roller ends out of the slots in the vacuum base. If the drive belt isn't completely broken  one end will be wrapped around the agitator brush  the other around the motor drive shaft. Slide the belt off of each part. Take it to a hardware store to get a replacement.4. Inspect the agitator brush before installing the new belt. Sometimes thread or hair will wrap around the ends or elsewhere on the brush roller. This can prevent the agitator from turning and cause a belt to fail prematurely. Cut any thread or hair with a sharp knife and pull it off.5. Install the new belt. Slide one end over the agitator brush and the other over the drive shaft. Then reinstall the agitator brush. You may have to pull on the agitator brush to stretch the new belt a bit so the roller ends fit into the vacuum base.6. Reinstall the bottom plate.

264,What are some good locations for weddings in the East SF Bay area in July?,I'm partial to locations with historic charm.If you don't have too many guests  you may want to consider the Piedmont Community Center.  It doesn't sound very digified  but it's really lovely. It's situated in a beautiful park and the ballroom opens up to a patio.  Sometimes they have the wedding ceremony on the patio and reception indoors.Also  you may want to consider the Brazilian Room in Tilden Park.  It has a beautiful setting for a outdoor ceremony and a nice but not too formal banquet hall. I think this place is a popular location for Cal grads.There's always the Clarmont which has a wonderful location for an outdoor ceremony and nice banquet facilitiesBTW: if you're planning a wedding for next year  get a headstart before the X'mas holidays.  Apparently  alot of couples get engaged over the holidays and there is a mad competitive dash to book venues in Jan and FebHappy planning!
265,Loving Stepchildren?,No  because the child is not going to accept you as a substitute for her other parent. You should do what you can to get to know the child  and take care of her  and do everything you can to support her during what is always a tough transition.  Eventually you might love that child as your own  but I don't think it is a sign of failure if you don't. Loving relationships come in all flavors  and  yours may be more of a friendly respectful relationship  especially if the child is older.

273,Is there an easy way to open a brand new jar of jam  pickles  etc?,1. If the jar is new  use a triangular-tipped bottle opener to apply pressure and break the vacuum seal. Do this by placing the triangular tip underneath the lid and pulling the lid away from the jar until you pop the seal.2. If this doesn't work and you suspect that food is stuck in the lid  tap the lid with a wooden spoon to knock away the food.3. Wrap the lid in a dish towel to give your hands traction as you twist. Or put rubber bands around the lid to get a good grip. The rubber bands that hold together bunches of vegetables are ideal.4. If the lid still won't budge  run the lid (not the jar) under hot water for a minute. This will cause the metal lid to expand so it comes off easily.

283,Who is Earth-2 Superman and how is he different from regular Superman?,"It's relatively simple.  Back in 1961  DC Comics revealed that all of their Golden Age (c. 1939-1945) characters had lived on a different Earth from their Silver Age (c. 1956-1970) characters.  Some characters (Batman  Robin  Wonder Woman) were virtually the same on each Earth  while others (The Flash  Green Lantern  the Atom) were radically different.Earth 2's Superman was slightly less powerful than Earth 1's  mostly adhering to the classic ""Faster than a speeding bullet  more powerful than a locomotive  able to leap tall buildings in a single bound"" description.  Earth 1's Superman could travel faster than light  juggle planets  and had a host of super powers including super-breath  super-ventriloquism  and super-hypnotism.  Earth 2's Superman eventually married Lois Lane and became the editor of the Daily Star before (temporarily) disappearing in 1985's ""Crisis on Infinite Earths.""  Earth 1's Superman finished his adventures in Alan Moore's ""Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? "" a two-parter than wrapped up and resolved some 30 years of continuity.  Both Supermen were supplanted by John Byrne's 1985 reboot of the character  which was intended to simplify that continuity and start over from scratch.Earth 2's Superman has reappeared twice since ""Crisis;"" once in 1999's ""Kingdom Come "" and most recently in 2005's ""Infinite Crisis.""  What his role is in this maxiseries is undetermined as of this writing.  Earth 1's Superman has yet to reappear  but longtime fans can always hope."
284,"what is the origin of ""bubbles"" in cartoons denoting people speaking?","The earliest date I'm aware of is the following:""...but it is usual to associate the first comic book to [sic] Richard Fenton Outcalt's creation  'The Yellow Kid'  in 1896. Outcalt essentially synthesized what had been made before him and introduced a new element: the balloon  a space where he wrote what the characters said  and that pointed to their mouth with a kind of tail."" (from the Source listed below)Apparently  the Italian language associates comic books with bubbles by the use of the word ""fumetti "" which is a reference to smoke."

And if you pair up  you will most likely not have the best hand.If you are on the full blind and you get this hand  it is referred to as ""the big blind special.""  This may be one of the only times you should play this hand (given that nobody raises).  You might get incredibly lucky and hit trips (three of a kind)  two pair  a full house  etc.It also may be OK to play these when you are on the half blind as long as there are no raises and the full blind is a small amount of money compared to your stack.  It is good to be unpredictable once in a while."

290,What's the best dog for a small apartment?,Toy breeds are perfect for small apartment. They don't need as much exercises as large breeds.

So they are perfect for small place.I also trained my dog to go potty in a litter box. And I played fetching games with him in the apartment. He gets plenty of exercises that way.

You must be nominated by the President of the United States  and confirmed by a majority in the U.S. Senate. Justices are appointed for life (except in cases of retirement or impeachment).It is not necessary for that person to have experience as a judge (George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers http://news.search.yahoo.com/news/search?ei=UTF-8&fl=0&fr=slv5-&p=harriet+miers+%22supreme+court%22is not the first time a non-judge has been nominated)  just a solid legal mind. Generally when a President chooses a nominee  he will look for someone whose ideals and worldview match his own. Gerald Ford famously did not make an idealogical choice when he appointed John Paul Stevens (http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c11_f.html)and in subsequent years was rather disappointed at some of Stevens' decisions.There is a lot more information at the official Supreme Court site: http://www.supremecourtus.gov/

With reduction of the sauce  you should not have issues with purple chicken. Keeping the skin on the chicken helps as well. You should not use non-stick pans for any recipe where the sauce needs to have the additional flavor from carmelization. Also  you can always substitute a full flavored- but not too fruity or sweet -- white wine for this dish. The flavor difference would be negligible.Here is good recipe from Anne Willan's cooking school:

310,what is your favorite quotation from Henry David Thoreau ?,However mean your life is  meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life  poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant  thrilling  glorious hours  even in a poorhouse. The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the almshouse as brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there  and have as cheering thoughts  as in a palace. Quoted from the final chapter of Walden.  Best `k.

312,How to pick cantaloupes?,"More ways to pick the right cantaloupes:1. The best thing you can do is smell. This doesn't apply for watermelons. Watermelons are described below. As for cantaloupe: don't look  don't touch  just smell. Ripe cantaloupe smells very sweet and nice. Sniffing out the most aromatic one is the smartest way to pick a cantaloupe or honeydew.2. Thump test: hold your dominant hand as if ready to knock on a door. Deliver two or three good thumps to the round side of a melon. The sound should be deep and thick  indicating a dense  full fruit. A higher hollow sound can mean unripeness.3. If a honeydew is beige-skinned with distinct green veins it's probably not ripe yet. If it has a pale yellow color with bright  lemon-colored areas you probably have found a good one.Cantaloupes are unripe when the skin beneath the textured ""web"" is green. Cantaloupes are ripe when orange or gold.4. Another mark of desirability is a patch that's slightly flat and bleached in color. Melons that develop on the vine flatten under their own weight  and lose color where they sit on hot soil. In general  stem ends should be moist  not moldy. A good melon is firm  but not rock hard. It yields very slightly to pressure but has no soft spots.5. Ripe cantaloupes rattle only occasionally  so it's an unreliable indicator.To determine ripeness of cantaloupes and honeydews in order to pick them from the plant  the following indices of maturity are known:Grasp it firmly  give a tug and a twist. If it falls easily off the vine into your hand  it's ripe."
313,What is a good  all-around tree to plant in a Northern California garden?,"I love California redwoods  which are native to the area  but I assume by an ""all-around"" tree  you mean a ""typical"" tree (deciduous) rather than an evergreen.One really nice tree that grows well here is the Chinese Pistache.

332,What does the raining of frogs mean in the movie Magnolia?,"Raining Frogs has ranked among commonly disputed phenomenon for some time. Some believe it to be nothing more than urban myth. Others report actual scientific evidence depicting its plausibility due to heavy winds and other meteorological means. Either way  this dual interpretation is sort of ""the point"" behind its inclusion in the film  because it can mean multiple things to multiple people  depending on how they choose to look at it.Many attentive viewers have noted that the ""raining of frogs"" in the third act of the film bears religious connotation  which is referenced several times throughout the film. This is mostly done through the repeated appearances of the numbers 8 and 2 culminating the use of ""Exodus 8:2"" on an advertisement poster at a bus stop (during the scene in which John C. Reilly's character  Jim Kurring  is driving down Magnolia Blvd. and finds William H. Macy's Quiz Kid Donnie Smith breaking and entering just prior to the rain of frogs sequence). The passage referenced reads: ""And if thou refuse to let them go  behold  I will smite all thy borders with frogs.""Despite the biblical implication above  and the address of coincidental yet scientifically feasible phenomena via Stanley Berry and the opening narration by Ricky Jay  the inclusion of the frogs in this sequence seems to stem more from the thematic devices within the film  calling into question strange phenomena and urban myths laced with coincidence  and equating them to struggles of a personal nature. Each character in the film wrestles with ""letting go"" of personal and emotional baggage in differing circumstances  and the frogs raining down seems to indicate both a collective release in many cases (as in Frank T.J. Mackey’s final emotions regarding his dying father Earl Partridge  and in turn Earl's subsequent release into death)  and an awakening sign to others (the Gator Family  and Quiz Kid Donnie Smith).All of the characters are affected in some personal and emotion fashion via this shared experience  and each one interprets it differently. The inclusion of biblical and scientific support (specifically the work of Charles Fort  whom Stanley Berry is seen reading in the library at one point in the film) is meant to offer up evidence of both sides of the belief spectrum leaving the characters  and us viewers  to glean from the experience and interpret it for ourselves."
333,How do I make fluffy scrambled eggs?,According to Food Network  use milk to make fluffier scrambled eggs.Here's a recipe from the Food Network Kitchens site:Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk in the milk. Season the eggs with salt and beat the mixture with a fork or whisk until combined. Over-beating makes the eggs thin. As the eggs cook  the milk turns into steam  puffing up the eggs as they firm. The traces of sugar  fats and protein in the milk also help to make larger curds. The larger the curds  the more steam is trapped. Water will dilute the flavor and they will not be as soft and fluffy. Don’t add more than five teaspoons of milk per egg  because the eggs can’t absorb all that milk.Cook the eggs in a heavy nonstick pan or a well-seasoned pan to prevent the eggs from sticking. Don’t use too large a pan either  or the batter will spread out and cook too quickly. An eight-inch pan works well for two eggs  a 10-inch pan for four eggs. Preheating the pan over a medium heat also keeps the eggs from sticking.Add butter or oil – about a teaspoon per egg – and heat it. Add the eggs and let them begin to set; then  with a heatproof rubber spatula  push the curds to one side and let the uncooked eggs spread over the surface of the pan. Repeat this action until the eggs are cooked to the desired degree of doneness – eggs taste best when slightly moist.
334,Why does eating spicy food make you crave for something sweet?,We crave for the endorphin rush.  After eating something spicy  our nerves feel pain. These pain signals are immediately transmitted to the brain. The brain interprets this signal and automatically releases endorphins (the body's natural pain killer). Once the endorphins kick in  it creates a temporary feeling of euphoria. We then begin to crave for this feeling.The endorphins control our inclination toward certain kinds of foods. One of our strongest cravings is for sweets.  Sweets like chocolate causes an endorphin rush.  Chocolate is the most popular endorphin-producing food on Earth. Chocolate is derived from cacao beans that were revered by the Aztecs  who believe that eating chocolate would confer wisdom and vitality. In addition to sugar  caffeine and fat  chocolate contains more than 300 different constituent compounds  including anandamide  a chemical that mimics marijuana's soothing effects on the brain.

338,Are there any health benefits in currants?,Currants are actually just very small raisins--made from the Black Corinth grape--and are therefore a concentrated source of calories  sugar  and nutrients.  According to WholeHealthMD  they supply a healthy amount of dietary fiber (both soluble and insoluble)  iron  potassium  and B vitamins.  The World's Healthiest Foods points out that raisins have been the object of phytonutrient research primarily for their unique phenol content  which helps prevent oxygen-based damage to cells in the body.  WHF also notes that these dried grapes are one of the top sources of the trace mineral boron.  Studies have shown that boron provides protection against osteoporosis and reproduces many of the positive effects of estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women.  So the tiny  wrinkled currants you're used to seeing only in scones and stuffing are actually very good for you!

351,How to choose a proper lighting for the living room?,1. Choose lighting according to its application. General  or ambient  lighting brightens an entire room indirectly; task lighting helps you read  sew  cook or do paperwork under focused illumination; accent lighting spotlights decorative objects.2. Experiment with different bulbs to achieve the brightness  warmth of tone or clarity of light you're looking for. Warm incandescent  color-true halogen or super-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs are new on the market. The final type lasts up to 10 times longer but uses only one-third of the energy--for example  a 25-watt compact fluorescent is as bright as a 75-watt incandescent bulb.3. Use recessed lights  floor lamps and soffit uplights for entertaining and watching television instead of a harsh  single ceiling light. Add table lamps for reading or sewing  and track lights to accent art and architectural features.4. Shop for style and construction as well as price. Fixtures sold at lighting showrooms may cost more  but usually are higher quality  and lighting consultants can offer design advice. Custom finishes  blown-glass shades and halogen bulbs also add to the cost of fixtures.

354,How to select garden tools?,Here are the basic garden tools:1. A spading fork is your first tool. Before you plant anything  you will need to open and improve the soil. A spading fork looks like a pitchfork but has a shorter handle and wider tines. It is used to dig down into hard soil and break up the ground.2. Next  choose a hoe. A hoe is useful for weeding and cultivating the surface of the soil to allow for penetration of nutrients and water.3. You'll need a watering can. Long nozzles allow the water to come out at a very gentle flow rate and are useful for reaching across long distances.  Select a watering can that has a detachable spray head - this type of watering can is perfect for watering young seedlings.4. Choose a round-ended shovel for larger digging projects  such as planting shrubs and trees.5. You'll need a good bow rake  which has short tines on one side attached to a metal frame or 'bow.' It's used for leveling the soil after it has been turned and prior to planting  or for removing large clods of earth or rocks from the soil. You can also turn a bow rake over and use the flat side to smooth soil in preparation for planting.6. Select a pair of garden shears that fits comfortably in your hand. Shears  sometimes called clippers  are used for pruning  shaping and removing foliage or branches. Don't buy the most expensive shears until you decide you like gardening.

You need to cook the eggplant and get it really soft. I find that the most flavorful way is to place the whole eggplant directly over the flame of a gas burner on the stove and blacken one side of the eggplant. But if I do the entire eggplant this way it is too smoky flavored. So I blacken ½ and then I wrap it in foil and bake it on high heat in an oven until it very soft.(If you like really smoky baba ghannouj – you can cook the entire eggplant on the stove top over a burner turning it with tongs as blackened until cooked through and very soft)When it is well cooked through  let cool (can douse with cold water)  peel the skin off the eggplant (sometimes it is so soft that you actually cut in half and scoop the eggplant away from the skin.  Chop into small pieces. Mash two or three cloves of garlic to a paste with about the same volume of salt. Add to eggplant  Blend the tahini with the lemon juice and stir into the eggplant. Adjust seasoning.If using a food processor put cooked eggplant  minced garlic  salt  tahini  lemon juice  and olive oil into bowl and puree to desired texture. Adjust seasoning.TipsIf mixture seems too thick  add a little cream or half&amp; half.A pinch of red cayenne makes the flavors blend better.Play with the balance of the salt and acid (If salt is heavy it can be balanced by lemon and vice-versa.Can add just a pinch of ground cumin seed (toast it lightly before adding)Serve in a shallow bowl topped with a swirl of olive oil. Garnish with fine chopped parsley  a dusting of sumac or red pepper.

Though purists might insist upon pintos  these days refried beans of both varieties are available at taquerias and grocery markets (with the other canned foods).  Refried beans aren't really fried twice so much as ""fried well.""  To refry  add the beans of your choosing to a hot  heavy pan (cast irons recommended) that's been coated in oil (or  if you're going to be traditional  lard) and finely chopped onion and garlic.  Mash away with your masher or fork  adding salt and pepper to taste.  If you prefer your beans completely creamy  mash until smooth.  If not  set aside a cupful and add to the smashed mixture  then reheat.  Whenever I make refried beans  I always find myself bored with just the beans themselves  so I'll add finely chopped red and green peppers  mushrooms and tomatoes  or jalapenos.  Best `k."

397,What is malolactic fermentation?,"Here's a good answer to your question that I found in mainbrace website:""After grapes are picked in the vineyard  they are crushed  then fermented and aged  and then bottled.  During fermentation  yeasts turn much of the sugar in the crushed grapes to alcohol and carbon dioxide.  Between the fermentation stage and aging  many winemakers subject the wine to another step: malolactic fermentation.During this step the malic acid present in the wine is converted to lactic acid.   This has the effect of reducing the sharpness of the wine and introducing a smooth  sometimes even buttery flavour.   (Lactic acid is the acid present in milk and milk products.)Why do winemakers do this?  Although the process has been known for some time  it is only within the last twenty years or so that the demand for easy-drinking  approachable wines has led wineries to strive for smoother wines that can be consumed with comfort without long aging to mellow out their flavours."""
398,Why do men have nipples?,Ah  the never-ending question  but one with a pretty simple answer (at least I think so).In the early stages of an embryo's development  males and females are identical - head  body  arms  legs  and uh  nipples. Until several weeks later when the X or Y chromosomes kick in and the appropriate genitalia begin to form.I suppose the better question is &quot;Why does an embryo immediately form nipples  instead of after the female chromosomes kick in?&quot;Maybe this answer from&quot;A Moment of Silence&quot; can provide more details on that:&quot; Male nipples aren't exactly a genetic glitch: they are evidence of our developmental clock. In the early stages of life from conception until about 14 weeks  all human fetuses look the same  regardless of gender. At the tender age of 14 weeks post-fertilization  genetically-male fetuses begin to produce male hormones including testosterone. These hormones turn the androgynous fetus into a bouncing baby boy.Here's where the developmental clock comes in. By 14 weeks  when the hormones turn on  the nipples have already formed. So  while our male fetus goes on to become a baby boy  he keeps his nipples  reminding all of us that people  male and female  started off the same way.&quot;

402,What's a good home based business?,I would recommend starting with something you enjoy  find a wholesale supplier or make the goods/services yourself  and setup a store with eBay.  This is really quick and easy (AKA: cheap) to start.  If you don't know exactly what you want to do it is a good way to see how it will work without a huge investment.  If you are successful in that marketplace you can take it to the next level and expand into a more traditional business model with less risk!Try playing around with writing a business plan and see what your risk and financial tolerance is.  The link below is a good tool for planning a new eBay business  I would recommend you check this out first!
403,what is a tag  and why is it being hailed by some people as the greatest thing since sliced bread?,"Tags are like post-it notes that readers of the content leave behind for other readers. They give clues to the context and meaning beyond a simple description. They're like finding notes in a text book scribbled by a previous owner. You can usually gain insight into the material based on those notes.Now imagine there is a cross-reference of all those post-its and margin notes. More than one person can add their own post-it. You can easily find the most popular ""post-its"" thanks to an index of all of them.  This is where the real power of tagging lies-- in the weight and meaning these agreed-upon notes give.Of course  context is everything. Next time you're together  show her MyWeb2.0 and del.icio.us in action. Show her how the information is sliced and diced-- most recent  most popular  most frequently used tags. I find my parents only get these new paradigms when I show them to them in context."
404,Give me a recipe which is easy to make yet will blow away our thanksgiving guests.?,I like Polenta with sun dried tomatoes and chipotle as a side dish. It is really quick to make (About 15 min.)and tastes and looks great.Step 1: Make Polenta. I typically take 1 part polenta (corn meal) and 3 parts water and put it in the microwave on high for 10 minutes. About halfway through you should stir it. It will be soft and creamy.Step 2: When the polenta is done  you add chopped sundried tomatoes and some Chipotle sause (I get mine at Trader Joes). The more chipotle the spicier the dish will be. You can eat it right away  or let it sit for a while to cool off and harden.Step 3 (optional) Once it is hard  you can cut it in slices  and quickly brown them under the broiler right before serving.

406,which one is better ? BMW or infinity G35?,"When comparing these two makes it’s important to establish which two models and trim levels would be comparable.For this example I will use the Infiniti G35 Manual and the BMW 330xi (both 2006).First off is the pricing  where Infiniti beats the BMW in any configuration (eg  add-ons etc).From a drivers perspective the engine inside of the Infiniti is a very reliable and steady powerhouse with a slightly lower torque band than the BMW. Then again after driving both cars and driving BMW's for years I have to say now that I favor the BMW Inline 6 which is a pinnacle of automotive engineering. Its been retooled over the years but the engine is one of the most perfect machines that I have ever driven with gear ratios and compression that feel just right.The Infiniti manual tranny can’t really be compared to a BMW  who has honed their 6 speed to a silky smooth or dynamic box. Its true that what you put in is what you get out in a BMW  because you can drive them hard or soft and the overall dynamic I wouldn’t trade for an Infiniti  which has a noticeable difference in feel... its heavier but still a very capable machine. If you are auto sticking I still prefer the BMW Steptronic 6.In terms of comfort the 3 series has made a consistent effort to provide a very organic support to the drivers and passengers with the addition of the premium and sports packages. The Infiniti does have larger and more a more ""plush"" feel as well as a much more comprehensible navigation system. The inclusion of the rather complex iDrive system in BMW's has frustrated a lot of drivers including myself (although once you get used to it it does make a lot of sense  just very frustrating to start). The iPod integration in BMW's is still rather sketchy... you cant have that and certain components installed at the same time and ealier versions limited how many playlists and songs the stero system could actually recognize and play. Later versions are somewhat improved but the aftermarket additions by Alpine can be worth it if you are an avid user.In terms of over all feel the Infiniti has made more inroads this year in terms of creature comforts than BMW. I would suggest the addition of the premium package for improved audio quality in both vehicles. Already a nimble machine the addition of the Sport package for the BMW makes it a very satisfying experience for the driving enthusiast. I trust the xDrive system to provide more sure footing in all weather but I haven’t had a chance to test the Infiniti in other than optimal conditions.The Infiniti is a very nice machine overall. Good dynamics and characteristics make it the best bang for the buck but personally I would suggest to splurge and go for the BMW  which  besides its wonderful performance and better care package provided in the Ownership benefits (BMW Maintenance Program)  has better standing than the Infiniti."

410,How can Yahoo Q&A stop spam and abuse?,Maybe a look at the Wikipedia concept helps here. Anyone can edit articles  the frontpage is for automatically generated lists and for well known users who feel responsible for the site and remove bad content immediately.dmoz is a web catalog where people can submit urls and editors review it and put it live if the link is appropriate and not spam.Both systems are based on content administration from users that are willing to spend time for that. With time their admin rights on the websites grow. This is a big effort which makes it difficult for spammers.

414,I would like to purchase a BMW  should I upgrade to the sports package?,The simple answer is if you have to ask  probably not :)  The Sport Package offers more supportive seats and a more aggressive wheel and tire package and suspension.  The upsides are better handling and appearance(highly subjective)  but tires will be more expensive and the ride will be harsher. Test drive both and see which you prefer.  On the other hand  sport package models are highly sought after but the increased resale value probably doesn't offset the cost of purchase  so if you get it  get it for yourself and not the next owner ;)
415,I'll be in Bangkok for a week.

This place is famous simply because it's full of nightlife  things to do  many others all down a road. It's in the city's center.Enjoy your trip."

417,How do you get a toddler to eat what's good for him?,Get your toddler involved in food decisions.  Take your child to the grocery with you and make your child choose which fruit or healthy snack you'll buy today.You could also ask your child to help you prepare his/her food.  Make the preparation fun and creative to make your child excited about eating.The most important is to make your toddler see you eat the food that you give your child.  I used to give my child everything that's good for her but she refused to eat those food.  When I started eating healthy food  she started eating it too.

423,Honeymoon Destinations: Greece vs. Hawaii in March.  Any Suggestions?,We were in Maui last March for our Honeymoon.We had a wonderful time. It is less crowded because it isn't peak season  but nothing was closed.The whales are very active at that time  so whenever we looked out at the ocean we could see a splash or a fluke or a breech. It was wonderful and romantic. Especially when we were on the beach taking photos for the wedding and there was a huge splash against the sunset-- everyone on the beach ooh'd and ahh'd.But the sun wasn't always out  so we weren't on the beach everyday. That was okay with me because there is too mcuh to explore anyways. The trip around the island to Hana was gorgeous with tropical blue water crashing against black lava rocks.It is a very easy  laid-back place. Wonderful for a honeymoon  I think.Good luck!
424,How long has People magazine been published?,"People  a weekly American magazine of celebrity and popular culture news  debuted in 1974. The first issue  dated March 4 of that year  featured actress Mia Farrow  then starring in the movie The Great Gatsby  on the cover. People is perhaps best known for its yearly special issues naming ""The 50 Most Beautiful People "" ""The Best and Worst Dressed "" and ""The Sexiest Man Alive."" The magazine is published by Time  Inc.  a division of Time Warner."
425,Xbox 360 or PS3?,This is a highly opinionated question  and it really depends on what you like. However  I personally would say if you're only going to get one  get the PS3. I've never owned an Xbox  for multiple reasons  one being there's only a small selection of games I'd be interested in gettting  whereas for PS2 I have 43 games (including PSone games). I'm expecting some great games to come out for PS3  wereas for Xbox360 I'd be surprised if there's more than a handful of games that I'd want. But again  this is all just personal preference. You may decide you prefer the Xbox games. It depends on what games you like  what genres (if you enjoy RPGs then PS3 is what you want - PS2 has been the platform of choice for RPGs so far  and I would be surprised if the PS3 didn't continue this trend).Now  given all this  you also need to think about the Nintendo Revolution. It's going to come out later than the PS3  so you'll have more time to save up some money  and it's definitely going to be the cheapest console of the three. And with its unique control scheme (if you don't know about it  you can probably find the original article on ign.com) it's not so much a competitor for the other two consoles as a companion. Anyway  if you can afford it  I highly recommend getting the Revolution in addition to whichever other console you decide upon.Addition: Turns out the Xbox 360 is also pretty horribly bug-ridden. You might want to give it a pass.
426,Does echinacea really help prevent colds?,Well  there appears to be some controvery about this.

Moscow 8.29 million7. Istanbul 8.26 million8. Mexico City 8.23 million9. Shanghai 8.2 million10. Tokyo 8.1 million
429,What are the effects of parental favoritism?,From my personal experience  I've seen parental favoritism cause lifetime effects.My mom's brother was the favorite- she was the least favored. 50 years later  she still struggles with feeling inadequate and has a hard time trusting people. Because of this  she has a hard time maintaining friendships and family relationships.My grandmother and her sister were treated differently by my great-grandfather. My grandmother was treated as the most special. Her sister was expected to do chores  take care of the family etc. She ended up being the dependable  reliable one because she developed her independence. She also never forgave her father or her sister for their unfair treatment. My grandmother grew up needing others to take care of her.This is a pattern I've seen. Those that are favored end up developing few of their skills and talents. Many times they grow up becoming more concerned about pleasing other people. And many times they don't know how to take care of themselves.Those that are disfavored can become strongly independent  but they may also have weaknesses in their ability to trust others and form lasting relationships. What is true is that favoritism has an unhealthy emotional impact on all children  whether favored or not.A good book that deals with this subject is The Emotional Incest Syndrome : What to do When a Parent's Love Rules Your Life  by Dr. Patricia Love.

You can probably find places that will cater these foods.You might want to do a nod to your husband's heritage by serving foods his family makes  or remember a good time in the past-- like a tropical theme with pictures of your warm weather vacation. If the party is near a holiday or event  you could use that as a theme (the Big Game  decorate your own hand turkey around Thanksgiving!)You can't go wrong with serving his favorite foods-- you know he'll be happy.

443,Why are the San Francisco 49er's Sucking so Bad Again?,1.  Poor drafting.  Between 2000-2006  the 49ers drafted 55 players. Only 8 starters on offense from all of those draft classes combined  and only four at the 'skill positions' (Barlow  Lloyd  Battle and Smith).2.  Injuries:  9 guys on IR  including starting Center  starting T  starting FS and SS  starting LB and starting TE.3.  Four different starting QBs this season.4.  Barlow not a difference maker/elite back.  His 3.3 yards per carry are actually worse than last year!5.  Unimaginative play calling (other than first game of season).6.  49ers lead the league by a wide margin in number of series that go 3-and-out.  This leaves the defense vulnerable.

446,NiMH batter and charger interchangability?,Yes.  As long as the charger is designed for NiMH  and you are using standard size cells  you are fine.  NiMH chargers charge at a lower amperage than NiCad chargers  but between brands there are no issues.
447,what is the temperature on the sun and how to calculate the lost of heat per distance from it?,"You might not have intended it  but your question is a lot more complex than you might have thought.  It turns out that the temperature of the sun is a function of how deep into the sun you are  with the surface temperature being about 6000 Kelvins.  To make things even more complicated  the Corona of the sun (which extends in all directions around the sun beyond the surface) is actually 1 000 000 Kelvins.This fact is well established  but further research is required to understand *why* there is such a huge difference in temperature between the two.Now for the second part of your question:The light intensity of the sun drops off as the inverse square of your distance from the sun.  The ""heat"" is another thing entirely  because heat is defined as the average kinetic energy of particles  and photons don't count strictly in that definition.There are particles that come from the sun in the form of solar wind  and around the region of the Earth  they have a ""temperature"" around 1000k."

450,Why does my dog walk around in a circle before he lays down to sleep?,I found the following article:Before Dogs became the best friend of man  they lived alone in the wilds. They avoided man because of man's proclivity to eat any other animal that they could catch. When ever dogs became aware they were being hunted  they would confuse their pursuer with false signs. Pursuers only pursue when they feel they have the advantage  being stronger or bigger so the most effective dissuader was to indicate their size as being much larger  than the pursuing hunter cared to could deal with. This was how the trampling down of a large area for their bed began. (The pursuing tracker was to be itimidated by themassive size of a dog's bedding down imprint.) This ploy was so successful at enabling dogs to evade their enemies  thatdogs healthfully survive and most foes of dogs have abandoned their pursuit  however dogs still circle before resting.

458,who should I start this week in fantasy football? Delhomme @BUF or Brooks @NYJ?,Both teams have good passing d and both match ups are on the road.  Delhomme has a better #1 receiver in Smith although Horn is healthy and is pretty good in his own right but Brooks has the better #2 receiver in Stallworth so that balances it out a little.  Neither is a great option and it's a tough call so I think you gotta go with the guy who's performed better so far this year which is Delhomme.  You might want to check the waiver and see if somebody like McMahon - the new Philly QB is available as he's got a nice matchup this week and could be better than your two current options.
459,What are the options for volleyball leagues in the south bay and SF?,I would try IVL (http://www.ivlinc.com/) or City Beach (http://www.citybeach.com/sports/sports_volleyball.htm)
460,What's the difference between Allegra and Benadryl?,They are actually both antihistimines (although Benadryl does come in a topical formula).Allegra requires a prescription  Benadryl does not.  Allegra has a formulation that lasts 24 hours (the 180mg version); their other formulation (the 60mg version) lasts 12 hours.  I believe Benadryl allergy is a 50mg version (so you need to take a more doses per day for the same length relief).The active ingredient in each is different as well:  Allegra 180mg (the 24 hour extended version) has two active ingredients (fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride); regular Allegra's active ingredient is fexofenadine hydrochloride  and Benadryl's active ingredient is Diphenhydramine.If both work equally well for you  it's probably more economical for you to go with the prescription (if you have health insurance) - the co-pay will be less for a 30 day supply than it would cost for 30 days worth of Over The Counter Benadryl.
461,Why was the Passion of Christ a controversial movie?,"Jewish people were concerned that the movie would fuel antisemitism. A concerned Rabbi Eugene Korn previewed the film before it came out and made the following statement ""We are deeply concerned that the film  if released in its present form  will fuel the hatred  bigotry and anti-Semitism that many responsible churches have worked hard to repudiate.""Another controversial aspect of the movie was its graphically violent depiction of Jesus' crucifixation. Some Christians were upset that the movie choose to focus on Jesus' violent death rather than other Biblical themes like the resurrection and his life experiences valuing messages of love  tolerance  and redemption."
462,How did John Lennon meet Yoko Ono?,"November 9  1966 Indica Gallery in London during a performance art installation by Ono.Ono offered that Lennon pay five shillings to hammer a nail into a piece of plain wood shown as artwork and Lennon made a counter-offer: ""Well  I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in."

464,I'm new to road biking and need a bike under $1000. What frame and parts do you recommend?,I'd agree with TaraN's answer. Take the time to really find what you want. Take a lot of extended test rides. You might find that aluminum might be too harsh for you  in which case you might find that steel or carbon might be more comfortable. That's just one example. Lots of test rides will give you a feel for how the various bikes at a given price point can handle very differently. Without getting into too much tech-speak  you might find that one bike handles a bit more twitchy than another. Think of the difference as driving a Mini Cooper versus a basic sedan. Some bikes are set up more for racing  where you'll get a quicker handling bike  whereas others will handle a bit more laid back.Parts wise  you'll find the same component offerings on many of the manufacturers out there for a given price point  as TaraN pointed out. You'll most likely be getting a bike with Shimano componenets  with perhaps a mix of some of the manufacturer's own branded components (for example  Trek outfits their bikes with a lot of Bontrager componentry).Focus on the overall ride of the bike. For a $1000  you can get a lot of bike.Wade at The Spokesman in downtown Santa Cruz is a GREAT guy - very helpful  and yes  very patient. He's very knowledgeable and will set you up right.Also in that same category  I'd highly recommend seeing Vance Sprock over at Cupertino Bike Shop. He's just like Wade - he'll set you up right.Good luck!

466,How can I make a clean cut in something that is both metal and wood?,"I'm no expert  but generally speaking  a finer-toothed saw will make cleaner cuts (and slower ones ;-) ).  Among hand tools  I'd try a hack saw; for handheld power tools  a fine-toothed circle saw or perhaps one of those ""super disks""; and for table-based power tools  a band saw.  Either way  take your time.By the way  if you've got significant excess length  you can always practice a couple of different approaches before making the final cut."
467,Is there a place where I can see graphs of U.S. National Budget allocations for the last few years?,You can find tables (not graphs) of the US National Budget allocations since the 1940's in a single PDF:http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2006/pdf/hist.pdfIf you have your heart set on looking graphs  you can find several from the website for the US House of Representatives Budget Committee:http://www.house.gov/budget/chartsgraphs.htmYou can also see various budget  deficit and spending statistics  some graphed over time  on the Public Agenda website:http://www.publicagenda.org/issues/factfiles.cfm?issue_type=federal_budgetAnd if you want to really veg-out with numbers  try the Financial Management Service's website (they're a part of the US Treasury Department).  They provide reports (in PDF and XLS files) on the receipts  outlays and balances of the US Federal Government.  I particularly like the reports on this page:http://fms.treas.gov/annualreport/index.htmlHope this helps!
468,What is the ideal honeymoon destination which combines beach and adventure?,Negril  Jamaica.We took our honeymoon there and I can personally report they have the beach part down pat!We stayed at the Swept Away Resort (which was under different ownership at the time)  http://swept-away.com/honeymoon.htmWe loved our time here - just stay clear of hurricane season  though we did 10 days in early December without a problem.You could get your adventure quotient from activities at the resort  catamaran sailing  scuba  para-sailing  or day trips out of the resort into Jamaica with many activities to choose from  see http://www.jamaicans.com/tourist/negril/negrilDoSee.htm for an example. Jamaica is not that large  so you can easily travel to other parts of the island outside of Negril to satisfy your adventure thirst.
469,Can you tell me where I can find Oriental stores in San Diego?,For Asian markets there's a Ranch 99 at 7330 Clairemont Mesa Blvd. You can also try Mitsuwa Marketplace at 4240 Kearny Mesa Rd # 119 or Vien Dong Supermarket 4 at 5382 University Ave.

473,Is having similar culture important to make a relationship work?,Having a similar culture certainly helps  but I think having similar values is more important. It just so happens that people in similar cultures happen to have similar values. But if you're from different cultures and have similar values  the relationship can still work.
474,Who's the best Blues guitarist?,"There's no one answer to that question  of course  but my response would be that the best ""blues-only"" guitarist was Freddy King. After him  Jimi Hendrix  Stevie Ray Vaughan  and Eric Clapton are the best blues-rock guitarists. In my opinion. Today."
475,Would there be an AMG version for the R Class?,Almost certainly.  Mercedes has enjoyed great success with all of their AMG line so an R55 or R60 is not likely to be far down the road.  It will also be extremely expensive seeing as how the relatively pedestrian R500 is already at the $70K mark.
476,Why doesn't college football have a playoff system?,- The bowls came first and have to be dislodged- The bowl organizers control larges amounts of money.  Some of these monies are given to participating universities and their conferences. Bowl organizers do not want to risk lossing this money. And universities who frequent bowls want to be assured of still receiving the big bucks before switching. Hence bowl organizers are generally against playoffs and univerisities are only luke warm supporters.- Universities like to believe their players are really students (some actually are) and not semi-professional atheletes  so they limit the number of games per year.  Playing a game takes a lot of the players time preparing and practicing.  Also due the physical nature of the game  players need several days to recovery.  This limits games to about one every 5 days or so (about one a week). A playoff system would require the two teams meeting for the championship to play and additional 2-4 games depending on the number of teams allowed to participate in the playoffs.
477,Why do Volvos suck so badly?,J.D. Powers report annually on initial quality and dependability. Every year the European and American nameplates close the gap with the Asian nameplates. In recent years the domestic nameplates have surpassed many of the Asians  both in initial quality and longer term vehicle dependability. Perception usually lags reality. Especially for products that purchased infrequently like an automobile. European vehicles still are behind with some of the worst being the luxury vehicles that come out of Europe.

479,how hot does turkey stuffing have to be?,The turkey breast should register 180 degrees and the stuffing should be 165. But the key to getting the stuffing hot enough without overcooking the turkey is to pack the stuffing carefully. Fill the inside of the bird with stuffing  but don't press it in. If you would like additional stuffing  roast it in a separate roasting pan with chicken stock for added flavor. The best tasting stuffing will be inside the turkey  but this way you can be sure there will be enough to go around and no one will get sick!If stuffing a turkey  use a meat thermometer.If stuffing does not reach 165 °F when the turkey itself is done to 180 °F  further cooking will be required. During the added cooking necessary to bring the stuffing up to a safe temperature  the meat may become overcooked.

482,What kind of guitar is that?,"Can't answer your question exactly  but it looks an awful lot like a Gibson archtop or a Gretsch.  You can poke around either of their websites to see guitars that look pretty similar to the one in the picture.  There are particular models of Gibson&Gretsch that have the diagonal bridge piece that appears in the movie -- Gretsch calls it a ""chromatic tailpiece"".  I didn't see that Gibson had a particular name for their version but they definitely have guitars sporting that same shape.The one thing I'll agree with you about is that unless it's an anachronism (a modern guitar that doesn't belong in the time period depicted in the movie)  it's not an electric guitar -- you can clearly see there's no obvious ""soapbar"" pickup like there would be on an archtop electric guitar (there are sneaky mics/pickups in acoustic guitars today  but I can't believe that was available then)."
483,If I have a red couch  who color should my walls be?,You might want to go with a more neutral color  like taupe  beige  pale yellow or pale sage. Accent the room with strong colors  such as brown  red (to pick up the color of the sofa)  or forest green using wall hangings  vases  etc.
484,Where should I move to near Sunnyvale?,We were lucky to find a place in Palo Alto.  Great neighborhoods  lots of places to walk  bike paths galore.  I'm a big fan of the area.  Also  there's a Fry's in PA if you're so inclined.  Extra bonus:  Foothills Park in Palo Alto is only open to PA residents and is a beautiful park  from what I hear.
485,When is the best age to potty train my child?,"According to an article in Babycenter.com...There's no magic age at which toddlers are ready to start learning how to use the potty  but most develop the necessary physical and cognitive skills between 18 and 24 months of age (although some won't be interested in the process until they're closer to 3).Your child may be ready to start toilet training if he:• Can walk and sit down• Has regular bowel movements at relatively predictable times• Can pull his pants up and down• Shows interest in others' bathroom habits (likes to watch you go to the bathroom  wants to wear underwear  etc.)• Makes a physical demonstration when he's having a bowel movement (grunting  squatting  telling you  etc.)• Has words for stool and urine• Can follow simple instructions  such as ""Go get the toy""• Understands the physical signals that mean he has to go and can tell you before it happens or hold it until he has time to get to the potty• Dislikes the feeling of being in a dirty diaper• Has ""dry"" periods of at least three or four hours• Isn't negative about — or resistant to — learning to use the toilet• Understands the value of putting things where they belong• Demonstrates a desire for independence"
486,What is a good entry-level road bike to purchase?,"For $1500  you're starting to get out of the ""entry-level"" stage. I have a Trek 1000 and absolutely love it. I've used it for century rides  triathlons and duathlons no problem. The Trek 1000 was about $900 CDN. The only difference in the bikes up to the $1500 range is the shifters are usually a little better (they don't stretch as easily  which makes shifting cleaner for longer). The weight and wheels are basically the same.If you want to trim 30 sec off your race time  you might consider the more expensive bikes. But  you should be an elite athlete to really notice the difference.I'd go for a $1000 bike and spend the rest on pumps (road and home)  spare tires  some nice cycling clothes  tools and a bike computer. Maybe even a trainer for home use."
487,Who holds the single season rushing yards in NFL?,While it is true that Eric Dickerson holds the single season *total* rushing yards record  he accomplished this in a 16-game season. On the other hand  O.J. Simpson is the only player in NFL history to break the 2 000 yard barrier in a single 14-game season. O.J. Simpson gained 143 yards per game in his record-breaking season  while Dickerson only gained 131 yards per game in his. So  the answer depends on whether you are interested in total yards or yards per game.
488,Should US computer programmers be worried about outsourcing trend to India and other countries?,Yes  not any time soon  but expect the trend to increase as companies find ways to reduce costs. Get into management and your job will be saved.
489,If light travels faster than sound  then why do we hear sound first and then see picture when we turn on TV ?,In most cases  the television needs to 'warm-up' its cathode ray tube before it can start to display an image on the screen.The audio coils require much less charging time and can start to emit sound sooner than we can see the image on the television.

492,Anyone know a financial planning expert?,Primerica on Breckinridge in Duluth  Gary Bailey or Jason Heller
493,Does a spoiler over the rear window of a 2000 bug really do anything?,On the bug  the spoiler really serves two purposes:1) Visually differentiates the turbo model in a low key way2) By disrupting laminar flow over the roof of the car  reduces the lift (rather than increasing downforce) generated by bernoulli's principle.  It also keeps water off the rear window.Joey is right in his assessment of most spoilers.  You have to have a pretty big one to have any effect.  My Evo's spoiler is a good example of a functional piece (it is homologated as a racing aero part).  It's about a foot tall and has a flat airfoil.  Even with a wing that size you don't really see an effect until around 60-70 mph  which is useful on a track but not really on the street.  I make my spoiler useful by driving it on a track ;).Useful aero pieces on production cars usually take two forms  either a tiny lip on the trailing edge of a car (reduces drag and lift)  or a giant wing (which should be flat  curved wings are not as effective)  which increases downforce but also increases drag.  The Beetle's spoiler is really more of a lip than a spoiler.
494,How long is the wall of china?,The Wall stretches over a formidable 6 350 km (3 946 miles)  from Shanhai Pass on the Bohai Gulf in the east  at the limit between China proper and Manchuria  to Lop Nur in the southeastern portion of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
495,why stainless steel oven door gets hot on the outside when the oven is on?,My Kenmore range does the same thing. It's poor design.You can get a new oven or you can just keep your little one away from the kitchen when you're cooking (easier said than done  I know!)
496,How do I ignore someone at work who likes me and wants to date me?,"People can often be over-bearing in their persuit of another person.  I assume that you know his (or her) intention is to date you.  If it's been brought up  you can directly tell them that you are not interested.If you do not feel comfortable bringing it up  you'll find that ""hoping he gets it"" will be a long  possibly never-ending  experience.Being direct is best.  You can do it kindly  but you should make it clear.  You'll be happier the moment it is over."

499,What is the cause of the recent riots in Paris?,Two muslim youths were electrocuted in a power substation while hiding allegedly because they were being pursued by the police. The police have denied this claim. Their deaths led the immigrant population to start rioting. Reasons cited were that immigrant youths don't feel integrated into French society  and feel marginalized by politicians who refer to them as thugs.
500,Which is better  Mac or PC?,I vote for the Mac.a) I think the Mac is easier to useb) the Mac tends to be more secure than the PC.c) The Mac hardware tends to be better (if you believe Consumer Reports and depending on the maker)d) Mac tech support tends to be better (if you believe Consumer Reports and depending on the maker)I would argue that the upfront price isn't that crucial  because you may end up paying money for assistance to fix your PC or paying with your time to fix your PC.  I've heard of people's PC's so badly infected with spyware and viruses  that they've just junked the computer and bought a new one.By the way  don't compare Macs to PC based on Clock speed.  The Clockspeeds aren't directly comparable.
501,How many megapixels would be best  if i want a digital camera for printing regular size (4 x 6) photos?,3 to 4 MP is certainly enough to get you a film-like 4x6 print. With prices coming down you'll be tempted to get something with higher resolution but keep in mind that the higher resolution comes at the added expense of additional storage  larger file sizes  and longer upload/download times.Also remember that the key factor in producing a pleasing image is the quality of the lens -- much more important than simple resolution.
502,What are the best headphones for office/cubicle work with occasional travel?,"I've had a pretty wide range of mid to high end headphones (Seinheiser 450 [open studio headphones  high-fidelity $400]  Bose Triport [closed  deep base $150]  Bose Quiet Comfort 2 [noise-cancelling  deep base $300]  and Shure e2c (Canal headphones  noise-blocking  deep base $100) and the ones I've enjoyed the most are my Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones.They are pricey  but considering how much time I spend listening to music in my cube  they are one of the best purchases I've made.  The sound is really great and the base is very deep  though it does have a signature ""Bosey"" sound to it since it has to employ acoustic tricks to replicate low-frequencies at high volumes.  No one around you will hear a think when you listen to them.  You will still hear people talking around you  but they do remove ambient pretty well.The Bose Triports are very similar though without noise-cancellation.  Good base and blocks a lot of noise.  Best sound-quality I've heard for $150.The Shure e2c go in your ear and block out almost all sound.  The sound quality is pretty great for ear buds (they have many similar more expensive versions)  but they can be tiring on your ears and get cruddy after a while.If you end up getting larger over-the-ear headphones  make sure they are ""closed"" and not ""opened"".  While my Seinheiser 450 sounded great  co-workers could hear them way to easily since they were ""open""."
503,What should I look for when buying a laptop? What is the best brand and what's reliable?,Weight and dimensions are important if you're planning to travel with the laptop. Get something with at least 512 mb of RAM  built-in wireless  and CD/DVD burner.  Dell is a good brand  and has an easy to use site where you can build a custom laptop.
504,What is the REAL expiration date on my milk and eggs?,For most products with a Sell-By date  they can be safely eaten up to 7 days after the Sell-By date.  The exceptions are beef/pork (3-5 days)  and poultry  seafood  or ground meats (2 days).Eggs and yogurt on the other hand carry an Expiration date.  These items should not be used after that date.    If you eat the item after that date  you may be exposing yourself to bacteria or other pathogens.
505,Good pets for allergies?,"What you are looking for is known as ""hypoallergenic dog breeds.""  All dogs produce dander -allergins  but hairless dogs and single coat dogs will produce less.From the AKC's list as of 2005.  Interestingly  this list does change over time.-- Bedlington Terrier-- Bichon Frise-- Chinese Crested-- Irish Water Spaniel-- Kerry Blue Terrier-- Maltese-- Poodles (Toy  Miniature or Standard)-- Portuguese Water Dog-- Schnauzer (Miniature  Standard or Giant)-- Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier-- XoloitzcuintliIt is very try that some people can be deadly allergic to cats  but not to dogs at all.  Allergies are specic to the pet's dander."
506,who was the one that took Paris Hilton's adult video?,technically  they both took the video as there is footage of just paris with rob holding the camera and footage of just rob with paris holding the camera. then if you want to be really picky  there's the tv/nightstand/dresser or whatever they put the camera on when they both played who wants to be an adult movie star. but the camera is/was owned by rob solomon

508,Who is the most famous woman athlete of all time?,"Historically I believe it would be  Babe Didrikson Zaharias  who was a golfer and olympic track star.Answers.com's bio says: "" Mildred 'Babe' Didrikson Zaharias was voted the outstanding woman athlete of the century in a 1950 Associated Press poll. Though she gained her greatest professional fame as a golfer  she rivalled Jim Thorpe in her remarkable ability to excel at nearly any sport. She began as a basketball All-American  then won two track and field golds at the 1932 Olympics. Next she turned professional and began touring the country  exhibiting her prowess in track  swimming  tennis  baseball  and even billiards. In 1935 Zaharias took up golf and excelled at that  too  winning 82 tournaments in a 20-year career. She was only 42 when she died of cancer in 1956."""
509,Could a very powerful directional microphone pickup sounds from the past?,In a sense  any microphone is picking up sounds from the past  due to the speed of sound. This is similar to what you mentioned with radio telescopes.The main differences are 1) velocity -- light moves at about 1 foot per nanosecond while sound moves around 1 foot per 1/1000 second  and 2) that sound moving though a medium diffuses quite rapidly. Something really loud  like thunder  you might hear from 20-30 seconds away. For normal  everyday sounds  the delay won't be more than maybe a few tenths of a second.

511,What should I offer for Xmas to my grand'ma ?,How active is she? If she's confined or in a nursing home  keep it simple. Make her a photo album or frame a favorite picture. Bring her a favorite treat that she can't get on her own.If she can get around  experiences are better than things. Take her to a play or an outdoor concert or to a museum exhibition. If she has a favorite kind of food  treat her to a special meal.The best gift you can give your grandma is time with you! Visit as often as you can  and promise to do so on a regular basis.
512,Are electronic drum kits OK for a beginner drummer to learn on?,The Roland V-drums and their special mesh heads have got the best feel of the electronic drumkits available  but they are also pretty expensive.  An electronic drumkit in general is an expensive proposition for a beginner  because you need to buy all the hardware (drum pads  rack  sound module  speakers)  and the low-end kits will run you about $800.  -- You might be able to get them for a bit less on ebay.If you are worried about loudness you can get a cheap beginners set (~$300) and some pads to muffle the sound to apartment-safe decibels (~$50).To answer your question  even with the best electronic sets  using an electronic set will alter your feel - especially for things like rimshots  complex hi-hat work  and cymbals.  You can still learn a lot and play some great sounding beats  but it does not feel like a regular drum set.This may not be a big issue... if you just want to make music and rock out (and don't care about moving to acoustic)  then electronic is just fine.  If you want to be able to play on an acoustic set with a great sense of feel  then electronic is not the way to go...Actually I just found a really cheap elecronic set for $300... see link:

516,What was the first currency ever used?,The earliest form of currency used was large stones that could be used to get food and meat in exchange - this was during the stone age. Before this there was a barter of goods (so i am not considering it currency)Large stones which were round were considered more valuable since they were more difficult to obtainThe first recorded accounts of currency date back to 2000 BCE and silver or metal tokens were used to represent a stored value of grain. Also these were useful to ensure that a shipment of commodities arrived with the same goods that were shippedPaper money was used in the 18th century  but only in the late 18th and through the 19th century was a central monetary authority created in various states that had a virtual monopoly of creating bank-notes that had to be accepted as legal tender everywhere (Prior to this  the one accepting payments could refuse the payment if it was not in a currency which  had been predetermined before the loan or in general use: Note gold and silver were widely used as legal tender)
517,Where can I get ideas for our science project?,My daughter gets her science project ideas from infoplease.com.  She loves this site.
518,what are the materials that can be used to produce laser beam?,Materials that form an inverse energy distribution?  Not quite.There are three basic components for getting a laser to work.  First  one needs an excitation source (pumping source) such as a flashlamp  an electrical spark  etc.  Second  one needs a material (the gain medium) which can exhibit what's known as population inversion - the capacity for a material to raise the electron energy level from the lower to the upper energy states.  Nearly all materials will exhibit this behavior with some more efficiently than others.  Finally  one needs to direct the stimulated energy by using a resonator.There are many combinations of pump sources  lasing materials and optical configurations depending on the intended use.  There are solid state (ruby  Nd:YAG)  gas (nitrogen  helium-neon) and semiconductor (gallium-arsenide) lasers that come in a variety of wavelengths (colors) to choose from  again  depending on what you want to do with it.Just a little bit of background: My degree is in Physics  and I've been working in the lasers and electro-optics field for the past 10+ years.  You can see what my graduate lab at SDSU looked like at: http://www.equationlab.com/mtp/quantumblog/about.html

520,What is the difference between software and hardware?,Hardware is the physical componentry of a computer system.  Memory chips  mice  monitors  and keyboards are all hardware.Software is the information stored on the computer  so programs and data are considered to be software.  Basically  if you can email it to someone  it's software.

522,How can I make money off my blog?,having advertising isn't going to do you much good if you don't have traffic coming to your blog. if you don't already have a core audience  i would suggest some of the tips at the site below to generate traffic and then hit your site with ads.in addition  some online retailers have affiliate programs where you could receive a bounty (CPC) or a cut of their purchase if they end up buying something. perhaps your blog is about camping and you could direct traffic to a site that sells camping gear.

525,who invented the language spoken in the Sims video game?,"Simlish or ""Simish"" was co-created by improv comedians Gerri Lawlor and Stephen Kearin."
526,Is there any proven evidence that Mars at some point in the past had microscopic life?,"The answer to your question is no.  There is no absolutely definitive evidence to date.  We do have very strong evidence that significant amounts of water once existed on the Martian surface  and some recent results show that Martian water may still exist below ground  and under heavy packs of ice.    There are many scientists who believe that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere  which would have made it a considerably wetter and warmer place.  Given this  and the ability for solar system bodies to seed each other via ejecta from large impacts  Mars could very possibly have been seeded by Earth or vice versa many billions of years ago.  Still  we're not sure if life exists or every existed there.    The most recent chapter was the recent discovery of methane there.  Methane can be created by non-biological processes  but we have not observed the right conditions for this on Mars.  Another possible explanation would be a biological origin for the gas  potentially from colonies of microscopic organisms in the soil.    Given our current rate of deepening understanding  we will likely solve this mystery sometime in the next 50 years  but as of now we simply don't have enough evidence to constitute ""proof"""
527,should i trade Baron Davis and Joe Johnson for Allen Iverson?,Whenever you can trade 2 good players for 1 superstar player  it is a steal!  Because now it will open up another slot on your active roster and now you can play your other good player that's always in your bench.  But if you don't have depth  I wouldn't pull the trade trigger.
528,If I choose to open an email attachment  will it be saved on my hard drive too?,"Probably  but it can vary depending on which e-mail software you're using.Most of the time  desktop e-mail clients (as opposed to web mail services like Yahoo! Mail) will download the entire message -- including attachments -- to your hard drive before you ever see it.  Then if you delete the message  it (usually) goes away.If you choose to open the attachment  you're often given a choice of whether to save it or just open it -- but even just opening it means it's been saved somewhere  usually a temporary cache.  Sometimes  though  those ""temporary"" caches stick around for a long time.With web mail services  you do have to download the attachment before viewing it -- though in that case  your browser will probably put it in the same kind of temporary cache unless you choose to save it somewhere."

531,What is programming?,Programming is instructing a computer to do something for you with the help of a programming language. The role of a programming language can be described in two ways:1. Technical: It is a means for instructing a Computer to perform Tasks2. Conceptual: It is a framework within which we organize our ideas about things and processes.According to the last statement  in programming we deal with two kind of things:* data  representing ``objects'' we want to manipulate* procedures  i.e. ``descriptions'' or ``rules'' that define how to manipulate data.According to Abelson and Sussman ([ABELSON  1985  4 ])``.....we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combinign simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:primitive expressions  which represent the simplest entities with which the language is concernedmeans of combination  by which compound expressions are built from simple ones  andmeans of abstraction  by which compound objects can be named and manipulated as units.''A programming lanugage should both provide means to describe primitive data and procedures and means to combine and abstract those into more complex ones.The distinction between data and procedures is not that clear cut. In many programming languages  procedures can be passed as data (to be applied to ``real'' data) and sometimes processed like ``ordinary'' data. Conversely ``ordinary'' data can be turned into procedures by an evaluation mechanism.
532,What is the oldest magazine that is still in circulation?,Arguably  The Scots Magazine  published first in 1739.
533,Why do people sniff their fingers after scratching no-no areas such as armpits?,"I think one of the reason is because they need to know what smell is that...if not  will feel not comfortable when do not have the answer as it is part of their body...OR the smell will actually make them feel ""good"" :)"
534,Do you really need 8 hours of sleep every night?,i've heard several times that the amount of sleep each individual requires is based on a number of factors  some of which include age  weight  and even diet. everyone has different schedules  and each one is independent to one another depending on their own individual health.i'm not one to set an example  but i average anywhere from 5-7 hours of sleep on a regular basis. sometimes my body requires more  sometimes less  but it seems to balance out and i never feel as though i'm suffering from lack  or over abundance  of sleep.i've included a yahoo! health article to help shed light on some of your own personal sleep habits.
535,Can you recommend an independent BMW service shop in Redwood City?,Phil  I highly recommend D&M Motors in Palo Alto for Audi  Porsche  BMW.  They are very honest and good  I've been going for years.  they have helped me troubleshoot and fix some probs on my A4 that have confounded other mechanics  going the extra mile to do so. number is 1.650.329.9016.
536,Who is Scooter Libby and what did he do?,Lewis Libby was the top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney. He is under indictment for obstruction of justice and lying to a grand jury about his involvement in leaking the name of an undercover CIA operative named Valerie Plame Wilson. Many believe this leak was in retaliation for her husband Joe Wilson's criticism of the use of faulty intelligence for entering the Iraq war.
537,If God is both all loving and all powerful  how can he/she/it allow suffering to exist?,Frankly  the answers thus far show a complete lack of understanding of basic theodicy and even the Christian Bible.  Assuming that – as a Christian – you buy into Job’s tale as at least allegorical  then there is acknowledgement that you cannot know the mind of G-d.  To attempt to do so is itself blasphemous.  To attempt know the mind of G-d is to be G-d  yet we are admonished when G-d responds to Job  not with an explanation for Job's suffering but rather with a question: Where was Job when G-d created the world?And it was said:Job 401 ¶ And Jehovah answered Job and said:2 Shall a reprover contend with the Almighty? He who reproves God  let him answer it.3 Then Job answered Jehovah and said:4 Behold  I am vile! What shall I answer You? I will put my hand to my mouth.5 Once I have spoken  but I will not answer; yea  twice  but I will go no further.6 ¶ And Jehovah answered Job out of the tempest and said:7 Now gird up your loins like a man  and I will question you; and you make Me to know.8 Will you also set aside My judgment; will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?9 And have you an arm like God; or can you thunder with a voice like His?10 Adorn yourself with majesty now  and with grandeur  and clothe yourself with glory and honor;11 pour forth the outbursts of your anger; yea  look on everyone who is proud  and bring him down low;12 look on everyone who is proud  and humble him  and trample the wicked in their place;13 hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in darkness.Know that to contend to know G-d is to set yourself above him.A previous answer blasphemed: “G-d desires that we do not suffer  but as a result of the choices men made we have suffering.”And also: “But there is a plan to alleviate the suffering. And that is through redemption.”Lies.And “John 3:16”?!  I think that means “go Broncos.”An alternative explanation is the easy one:  there is no G-d.  You either believe that  or you blaspheme in the attempt to understand Him.
538,Where can you donate an old encyclopedia set?,Any public Library should be able to accept your donation.If you are in the Bay area  Sunnyvale Public Library is the best library to donate..
539,Why do most cartoon characters have four fingers instead of five?,Usually it is because it is easier to draw  and is the appropriate amount of detail for most comic characters.  Comic characters are generally simplified so the communicated emotion of them is more easily magnified.  The extra detail in the hands can take away from that simplicity.  So 4 fingers is enough to do everything that a hand needs to do without looking wierd (3 fingers is too few).
540,What does LASER stand for?,LASER is an acronym forLight Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
541,Is there another cure for headaches besides taking pain killers?,If you would like to cure headaches naturally  try to take a lime  cut it into half and rub it on yourforehead. The throbbing will go away.  This worked for me.
542,My boyfriend and I broke up because he is busy at work  should I wait for him?,Move on.  He's not into you.  You should read the book He's just not that into you by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo.      Go straight to Chapter 2.
543,Do these pants make me look fat?,No and you don't look for other people's opions to make you who you are or make you feel less of a person.
544,Which brands of saxophone are famous in US?,Selmer  Yamaha  Yanagisawa  Beuscher  Keilworth.  The first two are the popular ones.
545,Which is better  Disneyland or Disneyworld?,Disneyworld in Orlando  Florida definitely offers a wider range of choices and attactions with 5 theme parks (Magic Kingdom  Epcot Center  Disney-MGM Studios  Disney Animal Kingdom Park) and 2 water parks (Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon). In addition  there are over 20 Disney resorts to choose from as well as other attractions like Downtown Disney  Disney's Boardwalk and Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex.Disneyland in Anaheim  CA features the Disneyland and California Adventure theme parks  3 Disney resorts and its own Downtown Disney District.Disneyland is doable in a day or 2. The California Adventure park is smaller than Disneyland and probably won't take the entire day to take in. Disneyworld is definitely a 3-5 day adventure.
546,what is the max file size on UNIX?,It depends on which Unix you're talking about  and which filesystem you're using.For instance  some flavors of Linux have a 2GiB max filesize  unless the various programs are compiled with special options. The BSDs  on the other hand  can (mostly) deal with TiB sized files gracefully - except some programs (still) assume that you only can have a maximum size of 2 GiB.So  in short - 2GiB is the least-common-denominator of 'max file size'  but most modern Unices can deal with bigger. At least some of the time. :)
547,Would it seriously affect my chances of getting into college if I don't have a high SAT score?,"Unfortunately  the answer is ""Maybe"".If you are trying to get into a top tier school with very selective admissions  then a low SAT/ACT score is virutally a ""kiss of death"".However  if you are looking at most state univerisities  then a low SAT/ACT score is not too bad.  You may have to take a few remedial courses.MOST IMPORTANT!!  A low SAT/ACT score WILL NOT stop you from going to college.  And  in the long run  it really doesn't matter very much where you get your undergraduate degree (as long as the college/university is ""regionally accredited"").  For example  a degree in education from ANY regionally NCATE accredited school will get you hired as a teacher.  An engineering degree from ANY ABET accredited school will get you hired as an engineer.Enjoy"
548,What's the market share of GM and Ford together in the USA?,"From this article:http://www.detnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0511/04/A01-369542.htm""Their [U.S. automakers] combined share of the U.S. market shrank to a new low of 52.4 percent last month from 57 percent a year ago and 70 percent in 1999 when American consumers were snapping up light trucks and SUVs.""It fluctuates more than you would think  but right now (a 7-year low) it is a little over 50%"
549,How old should a girl be when she starts wearing makeup?,For special occasions  I don't see a problem with starting around 12 yrs old. To start wearing it every day  I think she should be at least 16. The important thing is to try to convince her that youthful looking skin is beautiful in itself  so why start covering it up at a young age?
550,Why do we get hiccups?,Hiccups are sudden  involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle. As the muscle contracts repeatedly  the opening between your vocal cords snaps shut to check the inflow of air and makes the hiccup sound. Irritation of the nerves that extend from the neck to the chest can cause hiccups.Although associated with a variety of ailments (some can be serious such as pneumonia or when harmful substances build up in the blood for example from kidney failure)  hiccups are not serious and have no clear reason for occurring.
551,what is the best pinot noir under $40?,SOme of my favorites:under $25-ish* Siduri Sonoma Coast  Central Coast bottlings (typically 90+ pt wines)* Acacia* Saintsbury* Chalone Estate bottles* Castle Rock Russian River- usually $11 and can be above average
552,What are the best ways to incentivise people to answer questions here?,"I think that  though counterintuitive  one of the most effective ways was to limit the number of questions a user can answer per day. A casual user will still answer the 11th question the next day  and more hard-core users will try to answer as many questions as allowed. For this to work  the limit has to be pretty small  at least starting out  so that it is reasonably easy for someone with other commitments to achieve it. Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer  which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. When more answers are useful  it increases the usefulness of the service  which in turn ""incentivizes"" people to answer questions. And by placing a premium on the number of questions a user can answer per unit time  the likelihood that the user will throw him/herself into it full-throttle but then quickly become bored is also decreased.See my answer to the question  ""Why am I only allowed to answer 10 questions a day here?"":http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1005120801767On the issue of the term ""incentivize""--it is shameless corporate-speak  but it describes an impersonal  profit-oriented process. To attempt to use softer language to describe something that is inherently cold  calculating  and opportunistic (though not necessarily bad or wrong) would constitute euphemism  and would be both misleading and dangerous."
553,Does anyone have a recommendation for a good CPA who charges reasonable fees in Indianapolis?,"i have used Dunbar Cook and Shepard and the accountant was very good.As far as the ""reasonable""part goes they may have been a bit more than someone down the street but if they are thorough and save you money-it's worth it  isn't it?"
554,Can you recommend a good credit union located in St. Louis?,I joined Meridian (recently merged with Anheuser Busch Credit Union) and have been very happy.  Financed two cars  have two credit cards  and a personal loan from them.  Very easy to do business with and great rates.
555,What bowl game will Penn State be going to?  What's the best way to get tickets?,The 'Joe Paterno' Retirement Bowl to be held some place in Florida.
556,What are those tubular straw things at construction sites?,"These are called ""wattles""  and are placed on the ground to prevent soil erosion on construction sites."
557,How many U.S. states are named after kings or queens?,Things get a little sticky in the counting process here.  See  the Virginias were one until 1863  so do we count them as one or two?  Officially there was only one Virginia to name at the time  but I think we're looking to count how many states are named after kings or queens today  in the here and now  right?  So the number I think you're looking for is 7!    Georgia - Latin or English - After King George II of England  Louisiana - French - After King Louis XIV of France  Maryland - English - After Queen Henrietta Maria of England  North Carolina - Latin - After King Charles II of England  South Carolina - Latin - After King Charles II of England  Virginia - Latin or English - The virgin country (or country of the virgin)  after Queen Elizabeth I of England  West Virginia - Latin or English - The western transmontane  counties of Virginia.  See Virginia  above.    Unless  of course  we want to squeeze New York in there too  because it was named after the Duke of York  who later became the King of England... James II  see.  I'll leave that one up to you.  Best     `k.
558,Should cell phones and PDAs be allowed in school? Why or why not?,I don't think Cell Phones and PDAs should be allowed since students may spend lot of time playing with (and showing off) the  cool features of these gadgets. Also  some features can be misused (eg. camera phones). For communicating during emergency situations  I am sure school phones can be used.
559,What ever happened to the Oregon Trail Game in Middle School?,Middle School??? God  I'm old.You can still get 5th Edition Oregon Trail  which runs on WinXP:http://www.surpluscdrom.com/ortr5thed.html?OVRAW=oregon%20trail&OVKEY=oregon%20trail&OVMTC=standard
560,How do you bring up the salary subject during an interview if the interviewer didn't bring it up?,Large companies usually have an HR person coordinating the interview for the hiring manager. In such a situation  its better to bring up the question with the HR person. After the first round of interviews  if you are being called back for further interviews  then I think this is a good time to bring it up with the recruiter.If there is no recruiter involved  then in my opinion you should not bring up the compensation question till you get the sense that you are being seriously considered. The exception in my mind is that if you are trying to make some decisions/choices while interviewing for multiple positions then you can candidly bring it up after your first interview is done.
561,Why does my BMW take only premium gasoline?,BMW engines are designed to run at a high compression ratio.  If you took chemistry in high school  you remember the ideal gas rule PV=nRT which essentially states that with increased pressure you get increased temperatures.  So the cylinders in a bmw run hot.  Premium gas ignites at a higher temperature  so it is compatible with the engine in your car.Regular gas has the same amount of energy but will catch on fire prematurely in your cylinders causing knocking and pinging which is bad for your engine.  If you put regular gas your car  it is smart enough to catch it but you will have less power.  Also a tiny amount of damage can potentially happen each time you do this as the car will assume it's premium then dial back in response to the pinging.  So I wouldn't do it for any extended period of time.It is important to know that cars designed to run on regular gas do not benefit AT ALL from using premium  so don't bother.
562,Do you have a reco for a clean  quiet and decent apartment complex in Chicago area?,"I would check out Apartments.com for the Chicago area. They have loads of large buildings that have units available. It is a great place to look for the perfect ""clean  quiet and decent apartment complex"" in any area. Do you know what part of Chicago you want to live in?"
563,What's the best place to celebrate New Year's in Santiago  Chile?,Probably any place in DonwTown (Plaza Italia  Plaza de Armas) those are the popular places. If you are looking for something fancier I wouldn't know  there a re a lot of private parties.
564,I need to get a wireless card for my laptop. Are all cards compatible with all laptops? Which one is best?,Q: Are all cards compatible?A: Not quite.If your laptop is a Mac Powerbook or iBook  you should get a USB wireless network adapter.And regardless if it's a Windows or Mac laptop  it's a good idea to double-check that it doesn't already have wireless capability built-in (most do nowadays).Assuming your laptop runs Windows  doesn't have a built-in wireless adapter  and is a relatively recent model (a Pentium II or newer CPU is a good hint)  then just about any wireless card will work and you skip the rest of this explanation.If your laptop is more than 7 or 8 years old  you need to make sure it supports CardBus PCMCIA cards.  Many wireless PCMCIA cards use the CardBus interface - it provides higher performance than the standard PCMCIA interface.  Unfortunately  CardBus slots look just like a regular PCMCIA slot  so you can't tell if your laptop supports them just by looking.You can  however  easily tell if a wireless PCMCIA card uses CardBus or not.  If it has a gold strip on top the end that goes into the PCMCIA slot  then it's a CardBus PCMCIA card.  Many manufacturers of wireless PCMCIA cards offer them using both interfaces.  Here's an example of a Siemens card (along with pictures that clearly show the difference between a regular PCMCIA card and CardBus card):http://kb.efficient.com/display/1n/articleDirect/index.asp?aid=45947&r=0.1037256Q: Which one is best?A: It depends on what your wireless network supports.  But  in general  there are several good options and at very reasonable prices.WARNING: If you want to buy a wireless card to use at work though  you MUST check with your IT department before buying anything.  First  they should really provide a wireless card - you shouldn't have to buy one.  Second  businesses often configure their wireless networks to use specific security features  and you want to make sure you buy equipment that will be compatible.OK  assuming you want to use this for wireless connectivity at home  then just about any wireless card that supports 802.11g (aka Wireless-G) will suffice.  I say that because most equipment for wireless home networks sold today uses the 802.11g standard.  And anything that you buy nowadays will provide more than adequate security and encryption options.Choice of brand matters a lot  though I can't recommend a single one because you really want to get the same brand as the rest of your wireless networking equipment.  For instance  if you have a Linksys wireless router at home  then get a Linksys wireless card.  Technically  most of the wireless equipment is compatible with each other (I won't get into the gory details of why that's not always true)  but if you get equipment from the same brand  then you know it's been tested by the manufacturer to be compatible.  And the software you use to setup the various pieces of equipment will be very similar and use the same descriptions for various options - that should make things less confusing.  If you're buying the other networking equipment too (e.g. the wireless router)  then I recommend Linksys.  I've never been disappointed by their products - good performance  reliability  support and at very good prices to boot.  And you can find their products in almost any major retail store that carries computer products (like Best Buy).Hope this helps!
565,What is Indie genre?,"The basic answer is indie (or independent) music is music that is released on smaller labels that operate independently from the mainstream music business.But more often ""indie"" refers to a specific genre of contemporary music that is based on combining aesthetics of classic rock  punk  garage and art rock.  I first heard the term indie rock starting to get used in the late 80s to early 90s to describe the music that was popular on college radio stations at the time.  I don't think the definition has changed much since then  but the types of music that fit in this umbrella have become more diverse  both in style and popularity."
566,Are there flea markets here in New York?,Yes  there are many.  My favorite is at Amsterdam Avenue and 79th Street every Sunday.
567,Why do women mean YES when they say NO  and mean NO when they say YES?,Who understands women? Women can´t understand women  so do you think men would? I don´t think so. I guess it is just part of their nature  maybe that is what is charming about them - although I do agree it can get quite anoying sometimes!
568,Why do human have five fingers and five toes?,"According to a column that I read written by Joël Carbonnel  ""Nature has never been able to count above five.""A researcher has discovered that when the limbs have more than five digits they become distorted into a bow-legged shape which seriously interferes with normal walking or running.http://www.positivehealth.com/permit/Articles/Regular/joel74.htm"
569,Who serves the best burger in the Bay Area?,A friend of mine and I did a taste test a few years back and had to concur with most experts and newspapers - Barney's. They have restaurants in Oakland and SF  although they may have expanded. Burger Joint on Mission in SF wasn't bad  and of couse In-N-Out is awesome for fast food.
570,What is the difference betwen a close knit family and extended family?,A close knit family is simply a family that is close--it could apply to a nuclear family (mom  dad  kids) or extended family (cousins  uncles  grandparents).An extended family describes a family unit that extends beyond mom  dad  and kids to include cousins  uncles/aunts  and grandparents.
571,How do you make a puppy stop biting fingers/toes/any body part while playing?,I don't recommend any physical punishment even though it may not hurt that much because your dog will lose respect for you or even fear you (if he's very sensitive).This is what I did when my dog bit or mouthed me and it worked very well. The next time she puts her teeth on your skin  scream and retrack in painful expression on your face. Dogs are very visual (that's why they respond better to sign language than to verbal commands.)If she runs after you and bite more  then scream and pretend to cry until she stops. Dogs bites you because it's fun for her and because she thinks it's fun for you  too. But if she sees that you're in distress when she bites  she'll learn to stop doing it.
572,why did the League of Nations fail? Who were the main actors in this failure?,The failure of the League of Nations to stop the rise of the Axis powers and the start of World War II led to its eventual collapse.  Economic sanctions that the League called for against Axis nations were largely ignored  no nation had the stomach to use its military to enforce League rulings  and Axis nations withdrew from the League instead of subjecting themselves to its judgements.  The United States was also not a member of the League despite Woodrow Wilson being one of its prime advocates.

574,Who had the shortest celebrity marriage?,Well  if you overlook one tiny but technical detail (Zsa Zsa Gabor was still married to husband #7) then Mrs. Gabor's marriage to husband #8 was shorter than Britney's.Britney's was 48 hours  while Mrs. Gabor's was just a day.
575,What is the difference between shareholder and stakeholder ?,The shareholder possesses a part of something  while the stakeholder has an interest (in the non-financial sense of the term) in something.The stakeholders of an organization could be its shareholders  employees  vendors  customers  communities where it operates etc.I have seen this term more and more used in the context of sustainable development: what matters is not just the wealth of the shareholders  owning money is now only one of several goals that also include having positive environmental and social impacts.As usual  Wikipedia has an excellent definition.
576,What's a good age to get married?,Age is not as important a factor as maturity. People become mature at different ages  and some never do.
577,How do you find the web site traffic (number of page views) for a particular web site?,Alexa's traffic rankings are a good way to get relative metrics for a site that you're not in control of.  Be aware however that their numbers only reflect the group of people that have the Alexa toolbar installed on their computers.Here is Yahoo's listing:http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&compare_sites=&y=p&q=&url=yahoo.comIf you are the owner of the site  you can take your webserver logs and run them through an analyzer such as awtats - http://awstats.sourceforge.net/

579,How will the C230 2006 differ from the 2005 C230?,They will be minor if any.  The 2005 model received a significant refreshing and it would not be cost effective to make major changes for 2006.
580,Is Lexus anticipating on releasing more models that run on electric / battery power&gasoline?,Yes  the Lexus flagship is going to be available as a hybrid- the LS600h.  However  like all Toyota hybrids except the prius  the hybrid technology is biased more towards performance than economy and has no special status with regards to driving in the HOV lanes.  It will be at least $70K and be extremely fast but no more efficient than mid-high 20's.

584,What's the best HD consumer camera?,I would wait for HD video  mainly because there are a number of issues with it.  It's such a new technology that HD camcorders will halve in price in a relatively short time.  Also  with HD video  unless you have a computer hooked up to your HD display  you have no way of editing and then outputing HD video to an HD capable set  so either you're watching raw footage or you're using a computer to watch your video.  Once HD consumer DVD devices come out  there will be cheaper solutions for both recording  editing  and outputing HD video  and this should all happen fairly quickly  in a year or so.If you want fantastic quality and have $2000 to spend a used Canon GL2 will offer much better video quality than any HD consumer camcorder  despite the lower resolution.  Otherwise  I would wait.

Instead  the devil gave him a pumpkin/turnip with a burning coal inside to light his way as he wandered round the earth.

592,Do bubbles in my '98 Subaru Forester's coolant mean that my head gasket is toast?,I think that may be a sign of a blown headgasket.I think if that might be the case the best thing to try is to check the oil to see if any coolant has gotten into it(I think its a brownish milky color if it has)  and also maybe check the coolant to see if any oil has gotten into it.Other things you might check are.  check under the car to see if coolant is leaking somewhere.  It might just be a leak  check the hoses to see if they are wet. changing a hose is quite a bit cheaper than changing a headgasket.those are some things that are easy to do before going under the gun to replacing the headgasket.

598,Do you believe in miracles?,At first I had a hard time with miracles. The whole idea of supernatural forces overidding the laws of physics etc. But then I realized miracles were just coincidences. They don't really break the laws of physics they just happen to be the result of some really odd one in a million chances happening that will never happen again in a million years. I am convinced there are perfectly logical explanations for all miracles. The only supernatural aspect to it is that God causes them to happen. God doesn't need to break the laws of the universe he created  he just alligns events to happen the way he wants them to and voila! somebody is cured  etc. Just quit calling them miracles and call them coincidences instead and realise that God engineers coincidences. They happen all the time.
599,Do animals dream?,MIT researchers have shown that animals do appear to dream  and their dreams seem to replay events that occurred while they were awake.

602,Why won't George Bush meet with Cindy Sheehan?,Because he is not aware of the responsibilities of being the President of the US.Bush has made a long history of ignoring the obvious for his own personal gain and arrogance. When things get bad  he has historically veered away from dealing weith things and people responsibly and run home to hide under his extravagant bed.Last time the walls were caving he 'found' Jesus.But Cindy is far too complex for his thought patterns to deal with.He'll meet with Tom  wacko preachers  torturing dictators  but cannot open his presidential door to a citizen and a taxpayer.
603,Can you give me tips on how to get over an ex?,Surround yourself with friends  family  people who love you. Go on a trip to clear your head. It doesn't have to be expensive  just go camping with some pals or take a day trip to a beautiful outdoor spot. Take up a new hobby. Now is the perfect time to start doing something you didn't have time for before. Exercise. Read humorous and uplifting books (NO romance novels!). Go to the movies (NO sequels to movies you saw with your ex!). Buy fresh fruits and vegetables and make a delicious homecooked meal for your best friends. Get out in the world  get some fresh air  stretch your legs.  Take some time to get to know yourself and figure out what you want in life.Whatever you do  DON'T wallow in self-pity at home. DON'T get drunk and call your ex! DON'T write your ex emails begging to take you back. DON'T hang out in front of your ex's house hoping to bump into him/her.

607,Best over the ear headphone for the budget buyer?,I recommend the Grado SR-60 headphones. They have excellent sound quality  and work well with portable devices (most higher-end headphones require an amp to work well with portable players). Some people don't like that they look like old-fashioned library headphones  but that also makes them less likely to be stolen!
608,Why are handicapped bathroom stalls always built at the end of the restroom?,Presumably because they tend to be longer/bigger to accommodate extra space  and the most efficient place to put a larger stall is at the end of the room. (It would be in the way if it were in the middle.)

610,How should I act on a date?,Some fundamentals for men: talk 30-40% and let her talk the rest of the time.  Open doors  pick up the tab  and make eye contact.    One big mistake I see guys make  and one that I made back in my dating days  is making the date seem more like an interview.    Sure  you want to get to know the person  but that doesn't have to be crammed into one night of Q&A.  Make an effort to strike up casual conversation  and talk about things that are in the moment.  Remember  people evaluate how much they like or dislike you based upon the quality of the experience they have in your presence.  If you are able to show people a good time  they will be attracted to you.  If you make people feel like they are interviewing for a job  they will not be so keen on another date. (Watch any episode of Blind Date to find out what NOT to do.)
611,What's the ugliest car on the road?,The Pontiac Aztek.  Cars like the Scion xB and Toyota Prius are polarizing cars but they sell in big numbers and hit their targets.  The Aztek was frighteningly faithful to its concept vehicle and answered a question that no one asked: what would happen if we put a sloping rear window and regular doors on a minivan?  Heads should have rolled at GM for that decision  the sales for the Aztek have been abysmal since its launch.

616,How did gift giving start on Christmas day?,"The tradition of gifts seems to have started with the gifts that the wise men (the Magi) brought to Jesus. As recounted in the Bible's book of Matthew  ""On coming to the house they saw the child with his mother Mary  and they bowed down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.""No one was really in the habit of exchanging elaborate gifts until late in the 1800s. The Santa Claus story  combined with an amazing retailing phenomenon that has grown since the turn of the century  has made gift giving a central focus of the Christmas tradition."
617,What do you think of any car made by KIA?,They are a good value and the Koreans have made amazing strides in the past few years.  While the first Kias were rolling suicide booths  it looks like the Sedona actually does well in crash tests (see link).  The Rio has also been updated for 2006  so if there really is a 2 for 1 deal  the 06 would not be bad.  The 05 is pretty horrible though.  Also  nothing is free so your friend can probably pick up a sedona without a crappy 2005 rio for even less.
618,Which Mercedes-Benzes are rare?,No current Mercedes is truly rare like the classics but the more rare models are-AMG ModelsV12 models (600 series)Mercedes SLR ($400K) made by McLaren and AMGClassic mercedes which are renowned as classics are190SL convertible300SL Gullwing1936 500KMy personal favorite was the little known but well loved 190E 2.3-16 of 1986-1988.  This was basically a little sports sedan tuned by Cosworth Racing.  Not that fast by today's standards but a beautiful and sporty little car.
619,"What is the best LCD monitor 19""-25""?","The answer to this question changes from day to day.     Dell flatscreens have a good reputation.  If you stay away from the very biggest screens (25"" for example) you can save a lot of money.SharkeyExtreme (www.sharkeyextreme.com) recommends 17"" LCDs for the most savings (~ $250).  If you want something a little bigger  they suggest the Dell Ultrasharp 2005FPW 20.1"" LCD.  I got one of those myself and it's gorgeous.  I checked www.shopper.com and found one for $518."

627,Public transportation options in Los Angeles?,Los Angeles does have a public transit system  including the Metro Red Line and other light rail. However  if you want to get around without a car  you'll have to budget significant time (and I mean significant) to catch connections and lines. Plus  if you miss a connection you can get stranded (I have many times). Not recommended unless you're on the main bus or rail lines. Check the MTA site for more info on transportation routes. Also call their help number--their operators can tell you if a line is particularly problematic!
628,can you use the new yahoo tivo service on directv tivo systems?,Hi I too have a DirecTV Tivo system and was wondering the same thing.  No  we cannot take advantage of the new Y! Tivo service.  I called DirecTV customer service twice just to make sure.  To add to that  the DirecTV supervisor I talked to said that since they're coming out with their own DVR they are not going to offer any further Tivo software upgrades.  Hope this helps--

630,Who are AMG's competitors?,AMG's competitors are the BMW M series (m3  m5  m6) and audi's s series (s4  s6  s8  rs4  rs6  rs8).  Also  Cadillac is coming up with some worthy competition with their V-Series.  (sts-v  cts-v  xlr-v)In general AMG tends to be more balanced on the comfort scale than BMW.  They are brutally fast but also very easy to drive and comfortable. For instance all AMG vehicles are automatic transmission whereas all BMW's use either a manual or a sequential manual transmission.  Audi is in between. S vehicles are available in both manual and auto versions.  Cadillac tends to be more on the sport side as well.
631,Why do taxi drivers in Rio de Janeiro never know where their going?,Knowing their profile  my guess is that it's more likely that they actually know excatlly where they are going  but they just want to make more money out of the ride!
632,Which company gives cheapest quotes for car insaurance ?,Progressive (800-776-4737) open 24/7 advertises that they will give you a quote for car insurance or refer you to another insurance company that will be cheaper.  This may be worth a free call.  I have had Progressive several years and they have been efficient and courteous.  Their claims service was streamlined when my wife's car needed repair after someone hit it in a mall parking lot and drove away without leaving any ID.  I believe their rates are relatively low.  You can always get multiple quotes to check - but customer service counts too.  Good luck.

Old English Sheepdogs and Collies are a different story!""Veterinarians  however  say less is better because frequent bathing can cause dry skin!"
636,Why is scrapbooking so popular?,"Scrapbooking is popular for several reasons  first and foremost because it's a great way to ""showcase"" all the pictures you take and keep stored in boxes.  Now instead of pulling out a shoebox of photos  you pull out an album with names of people  dates  place names  etc.  It's a legacy to pass down to your kids  or show your friends.It can be a lot of work  but the main thing about scrapbooking is you make it as simple or as complex as you want it.  The bare basics is just putting photos on a page  and labelling names and places.  If you really want to spend a lot of time  you can do what I call the ""gourmet layout"" which is where you put a lot of extraneous stuff to fluff it up.  Or you can go somewhere in between.  It's all what you make of it!"
637,How come it seems like Lottery winners are always the ones that buy tickets in low income areas.?,"I would put it down to psychology.People who feel they are well-off feel no need to participate in the lottery programs. While those who feel they are less than well off think ""Why not bet a buck or two on the chance to make a few million?"".It would seem to make sense to me.addition: Yes Matt - agreed. I just didn't state it as eloquently. Feeling 'no need to participate' is as you say related to education  and those well off tend to have a better education."

639,Why is the shifter in a Prius like a joystick? and does it worsen the driving experience?,The Prius has a CVT (continuously variable transmission) which does not employ normal gears.  As a result  the shifter is just a switch and can take any form that the designers choose to implement.  Additionally  since it is totally automatic and transparent in operation  it has a minimal impact on the driving experience as one rapidly grows accustomed to the controls and the driver doesn't interact with it except when putting it in park  drive  or reverse  not actions that occur more than a couple times each trip.

642,How do I protect myself from credit card scam?,If you dont want to pay for the services such as bank of america here are a couple of things you can do to reduce your chances of your identity being stolen1. shred all your mail2. By law  you can request 1 copy of your credit history every year from each of the three credit history companies at  www.annualcreditreport.comI suggest you stagger your requests to each of them i.e. request experian first then 4 months later request another report from transunion  and another 4 months later from equifax. this way you get a free report every 4 months.3. dispute anything that is wrong (most common: credit cards forget to tell the credit history guys that you closed your account or paid all your loans in full)4. when online  try to use virtual credit numbers to make the purchases. this facility is available for citicard customers  and maybe amex. the virtual numbers are good only for 1 use  and useless after that. so if someone steals that  it is useless.5. when buying something offline  save your receipts  and make sure your statement is accurate. (a favourite scam is to charge maybe 50cents on a statement  that way you dont notice it  but a scammer who charges 10 000 card owners 50cents a month can make $5000 a month no sweat -- and you dont even realize it)6. also dont forget to shread any credit card solicitations you dont plan to use.

646,What will the gun ban in the city accomplish? Will crime rate in San Francisco drop?,"The gun ban meassure makes it illegal to posses or sell firearms and ammunition anywhere in the city of San Francisco.  The National Rifle Association has sued to overturn this ban. When a similar ban passed in 1982  the NRA sued and succesfully overturned the ban.As for crime rate  it is hard to predict.  A common argument made by right wing gun supporters says  ""when guns are outlawed  only outlaws will sell guns.""  And Michael Moore  a prominent left wing activist and film maker  concluded in his film ""Bowling for Columbine"" that it is not necessarily the guns that make American culture violent (he points to how Canadians have even greater access to firearms  yet their crime rate is significantly lower).Anti-gun arguments include: *Citizens have no need to own guns to protect themselves against crime because government is tasked with that obligation. *Guns  being devices implicitly designed to kill  raise the level of violence in any disagreement between people. *Guns are more dangerous to the owners than to intended targets because most gun related deaths are a result of domestic violence  accidents  and suicides.According to the third link below  when D.C. banned firearms in 1976  the murder rate increased:""Crime has risen significantly since the gun ban went into effect. In the five years before Washington's ban in 1976  the murder rate fell from 37 to 27 per 100 000. In the five years after it went into effect  the murder rate rose back up to 35. In fact  the murder rate after 1976 has never fallen back to what it was in 1976. Robberies and overall violent crime changed just as dramatically.""But obviously in the real world there are many variables that affect the crime rate.  So it is hard to truly measure what kind of impact a gun ban has on crime rate since you cannot isolate it from all of the other variables."
647,Is Poker the new Golf?,Yes.  Like golf  you can spend a lifetime working on your game and still see room for improvement.  Like golf  no matter what your skill  you can always have a bad day.

648,What is the difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree?,One difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree are the requirements. To gain eligibility for a Bachelors  you must have at least a GED and have scored well enough on the SAT. To be eligible for a Masters Degree  you must have completed a Bachelors degree program  and adequate scores on the GRE.In addition  as a Bachelors degree student  your first year or two focuses on the acquisition of general knowledge and the last few years become more specialized  focusing primarily on classes for your major/minor area.In contrast  the Master's degree program takes usually only 2 years to complete and the student is only focused on learning one speciality area during that time. In addition  a Masters program requires the student to be more of an independent learner  with classes requiring much more research and independent thought.
649,What's the difference between a divorce and an anullment?,"Taken from divorcenet.com:""A ""divorce"" is the legal separation and termination of the marital relationship by the judgment of a court which may be granted only upon a finding by the court that certain ""grounds"" for divorce exist. A divorce puts an end to the marital relationship.An ""annulment"" is a decree from a court determining that the marriage is legally invalid because of some defect that existed at the time the marriage was entered into. An annulment decree declares that a marital status never existed  unlike a divorce decree that terminates a marriage. The grounds for an annulment include: an underage marriage; bigamy (i.e. one of the parties has another living spouse); mental incompetence of one of the parties; fraud; duress and nonconsummation of the marriage (which may include impotency)."""
650,What Canon EF L series lens should I get for my Digital Rebel?,It depends on what you shoot. For wild life a long telephoto zoom like the 100-400L IS is very convenient. Note that this is a f/5.6 lens (at 400) so is not particularly fast but it is very sharp and the range is very convenient. I've rented this lens a few times and I've always been happy with the results.If you prefer a fast lens the 70-200/2.8 IS is probably the best zoom made by Canon. Very sharp  fast  well made and favored by professionals.Those two lenses are expensive and heavy. If you prefer something lighter:The 70-300 DO IS (strictly speaking not an L lens but close enough) is very light and convenient  especially for travel.Not cheap though.And finally the 70-200/4L is cheap  is not nearly as heavy as the 2.8 lenses  and takes great photos. It doesn't have image stabilization so you'll need to use faster shutter speeds than with the previous lenses  or use a tripod.I personally own the 70-200/2.8L IS and a 75-300/4.0-5.6 III lens. The 75-300 is nowhere near the quality of any of the previous lenses  but it is very light and easy to carry.
651,In World of Warcraft  do I have to physically stay near Battle Masters to get into Battlegrounds?,You can go wherever you like. You will only be forced out of the queue if you log off. People generally stick around because they're bored and don't have other things to do  or are just talking  or whatever. I usually go to a battlemaster  join a queue  then fly out somewhere else (at the moment it's Arathi Mountains) and go grind or do quests or whatever. You could even go to the other continent if you want.
652,When did women start competing in sports?,"I'm sure it would be impossible to pin down the first competitive women's athletic event in the world.A couple of milestones  though:1921: Monte Carlo hosts ""the first true international meeting for women...

Since it's only been a month and you're not fully invested in the relationship yet  take it easy and see where it goes. I'd say if it's still the same in a month or two  ditch him.

658,How many miles should I go before I need to get the oil changed?,"Since you drive a BMW  the car will tell you when to change the oil.  Oil life is determined by a variety of factors including highway vs city mileage  temperature  average rpm  load factor  etc.  The ""every 5000K miles"" recommendation from most car companies is a calculated guess but BMW's have a system that take these factors into account.  So basically when the car tells you to do it  you should do it.  You can even do it yourself  it only takes about 20 minutes of your time once you learn."
659,Which brands of vaccum cleaners are well suited for both carpet cleaning and floors?,I believe you might have heard about Dyson and its owner talking in the commercial about how good his Vaccum cleaner was..I own one of these machines and its amazing  Its worth for the price of around 425 dollars.. I ran a simple test of vaccuming with my old Hoover vaccum cleaner and then with the Dyson and I was surprised to see how much dust it sucked up..Its good on the floor too as I use it on my wooden floor and I dont see any scratches on my floor.
660,What is the world's smallest digital camera which still produces high quality pictures?,Quality is such a subjective question.  In order to get small size and maintain image quality  you need one key feature: autofocus.Of course  it's a compromise.  The smallest digital camera that takes decent pictures (much better than most camera phones  for instance) is the Sony DSC-U40.  It's 2 megapixels and has an autofocus lens.  It has no zoom  but that's sort of necessary given the size.  It's 3.3 x 1.5 x 1 in.If you want a zoom I'd recommend the Canon PowerShot SD30.  By using a molded glass aspherical lens  they've made an incredibly compact 5 MP digital camera with a 2.6X zoom.  It's only slightly larger and takes significantly better pictures.  Size is 3.8 x 1.8 x .9 inches.  See the attached link for a sample pic from the camera.
661,What are the qualities that a good friend should have?,kind  honest  loyal  respectful  etc.  A good friend should treat friends the way he/she wants to be treated.  He/she must keep must know how to keep promises.  He/she must listen when a friend is talking.   He/she must know how to share.  He/she must be considerate.

663,Why is news and media coverage in the USA so inwardly focused?,"A large part of the America-centric focus of the American media is as a result of its structure. Let me explain: the American media is more privatized than any other media system in the world. Take the BBC  for example  it is a government-sponsored media outlet (rather than commercially sponsored) and it was conceived as a tool to educate the public. The American media -- first print  then radio  then television -- evolved as a system that is primarily supported by the money advertisers pay broadcasters for ad space. Advertisers are interested in at least two things: 1) the largest audience share (they race to capture the median viewer); and 2) a lack of controversy out of fear that their brand image might suffer in the mind of the public. This is part of the reason why the media pick domestic topics and focus on high-profile domestic personages (less controversy  and more ""relevant"" to the daily lives of Americans  so thus  more watched). Another reason has to do with the news cycle of the American media. In many countries  the news is still a half-hour  hour  or couple hours per day. In the U.S. with cable news  the news cycle is now 24-hours. This constant pressure to always be turning out stories gives journalists incentives to make their story production as efficient as possible. In practice  this means developing a set of official contacts that they can rely upon for sound bites that relate to their reporting areas. They build trust with these contacts and can count upon them to respond quickly. With major news bureaus tending to be on the east coast of the U.S.  it is easier for journalists to develop ongoing relationships with officials who don't live at great geographic distances (even with the Internet  I'd argue). Also  with the rise in prominence of public relations firm (firms that specialize in creating news-worthy promotional material that frames their organizational or individual clients in a favorable light)  information about celebrities and American personages is readily available and pre-processed for journalists to be newsworthy  and thus  such material is exceptionally appealing to journalists who by and large are ALL on a very tight deadline.Some communications researchers in the past have argued that -- with the exception of the elite -- most everyone in all countries would be interested in more gossip  lifestyle  and entertainment news. What stops some countries from providing it is either an authoritarian regime  or perhaps the more benevolent goal of providing an educational service.If you're really interested in this topic  I suggest a couple of interesting books: *The Creation of the Media* by Paul Starr  and *Deciding What's News* by Herbert J. Gans  both of whom are scholars of great repute."
664,What are the best single tracks for Mt. biking in the bay area?,Here are my favorite mountain bike trails in the Bay Area:-Upper Stevens Creek which hooks up to the Montbello Preserve in the Cupertino/Saratoga Foothills-St. Joseph's Hill in Los Gatos-Fort Ord / Laguana Seca near Montery-Wilder Ranch in Santa Cruz-Nisene Marks in Santa Cruz-Fremont Older in Cupertino/Saratoga
665,Restaurant recommendations for Costa Rica?,Las Delecias Del Maiz is as authentic as you can get--the restaurant is full of locals  and the food is incredibly delicious. Every Wednesday  they make a tasty beef and vegetable soup. If you don't know what to try  get the Fiesta de Gallo  which is a sampler plate with Arroz con Pollo  grilled beef and pork  Picadillos de Papa  plantains  and tortilla. Also try the corn pancake dipped in yogurt.http://www.deliciasdelmaiz.com
666,How much does it cost to replace garage door torsion springs?  Can I do it myself?,Not a good idea to replace that yourself.  Too much opportunity to hurt yourself.  Especially when you are dealing with a large metal spring under tension.When I had them replaced on my house  the cost was only  like $50 + parts.  So not bad at all.
667,Are there any tricks to peeling a butternut squash?,If you can  cook it first. the skin peels away very easily after it's been roasted (better to roast than boil).If you need to cut up into chunks for sauteeing or something  do this:1. Cut lengthwise  and then into quarters. Cut in 1/2 lengthwise again if very large (should look like watermelon slices).2. Take sharp knife parallel to cutting surface and place right between skin and flesh.3. Run knife along the bottom and remove flesh from the skin. Place hand on top of squash flesh to keep pressure on.4. cut up into cubes or whatever shape.And remember it should feel more like running the squash along the knife  than moving a knife through the squash. Small difference  but results in fewer cuts.

671,"What does ""folksonomy"" mean?","Folksonomy is a word formed from a combination of ""folk"" and ""taxonomy"".  It's a recently developed concept of the general public categorizing information according to what's most useful for the masses  and is considered in opposition to the sometimes more formal classification systems created by an entity such as the Library of Congress or Yahoo!.Folksonomies are often implemented using tags.  An advantage of tags over a hierarchical taxonomy is that it's easy to apply multiple tags to a single item  rather than having to decide which category to place the item in."
672,What was the #1 single on July 7  1968,"Great question! Because apparently ""the web"" doesn't have the answer.  But to save you the trouble  I wanted to share what I DID find:Top 10 Songs of 1968 featured on the Billboard Top Pop Hits CD:1. Classical Gas - Mason Williams2. A Beautiful Morning - The Rascals3. Honey - Bobby Goldsboro4. Love Is Blue - Paul Mauriat5. Young Girl - The Union Gap6. Spooky - Classics lV7. Harper Valley P.T.A.8. Abraham  Martin And John - Dion9. Slip Away - Clarence Carter10. Hush - Deep Purpleand on the Top Rock n Roll CD from Billboard:1. Tighten Up - Archie Bell&The Drells2. Judy In Disguise (With Glasses) - John Fred&His Playboy Band3. (Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay - Otis Redding 4. People Got To Be Free - The Rascals5. Chain Of Fools - Aretha Franklin6. Green Tambourine - The Lemon Pipers7. Cry Like A Baby - The Box Tops8. Mony Mony - Tommy James&The Shondells9. Yummy Yummy Yummy - Ohio Express10. The Horse - Cliff Nobles&Co.ONE of those songs was #1 on July 7  1968.and on the ""This Day in Music History"" site (resourced below)  there are matches for top singles for July 7th  but not for the year 1968.and Finally  on July 7  1968  Led Zeppelin was officially founded by Jimmy Page. And THAT  is worth a mention.My guess is that the #1 song on Billboard's chart for July 7  1968 was already on the charts for several days or weeks.Check out the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame's timeline  below. It's a time-killer  but your answer may be in there."
673,what is the best day of the week?,Saturday. No school  no work  no obligations. Sundays sometimes have a pall over them because you know you have to go back to work the next day!
674,What's the safest and most effective way to control acne and reduce blemishes?,Get your Dr. to give you a prescription for Retin-A.  It's a topical ointment that really dries up blemishes.  However  if you have already dry skin  it might be too strong.  In that case  I would go to the drug store and buy a topical product that contains salicylic acid (I like Johnson&Johnson Clean&Clear).One other way I keep my skin clear is by making sure I hydrate - I drink boatloads of water (my aesthetician always comments on this when I go in for facials).  You might want to try splurging on a facial - ask the aesthetician about your skin type and about the kinds of products s/he would recommend you use.
675,Where can I renew my passport in Phoenix asap?,If you need it sooner than 2-3 weeks  you are going to have to drive to LA.  That is the closest emergency renewal center.  I had a family emergency in Italy and had to fly there immediately.  I had to drive to LA to do it.  On the positive side  I was flying out of there for cheaper anyways.  Good luck
676,which is the largest lake in the United States?,"I'll assume that when you write ""largest"" that you are referring to the surface area of the lake. Superior is the largest lake that's partly in the United States at 31 820 square miles. The largest lake entirely contained in the United States is Lake Michigan  22 400 square miles. Excluding the great lakes  the Great Salt Lake in Utah is the largest lake in the USA at 1700 square miles.There is a little bit of controversy  as some believe that Lake Michigan and Luke Huron are really one lake at 45 410 square miles. So  depending on who you ask  the answer could be the bi-national Lake Michigan/ Lake Huron  the bi-national Lake Superior  the possibly-only-half-a-lake Lake Michigan or the Great Salt Lake. You could even take it a step further-- if you consider Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to be one lake  you only want to consider lakes entirely within the United States  and you want to restrict it to fresh water lakes  you'd have to look further.Lake Iliamna is the next in line at 1000 square miles. But it's in Alaska  so if you restrict yourself to the 48 contiguous states  you need to cast a wider net still. Lake Okeechobee is next at 700 square miles-- but it's really more of a swamp. So you may want to look even further to Lake Champlain at 490 square miles.So take your pick-- Michigan/Huron  Superior  Michigan  Great Salt  Iliamna  Okeechobee or Champlain!"
677,Are Wireless Networks Secure?,"Unfortunately  no computer network is truly secure. It's always theoretically possible for eavesdroppers to view or ""snoop"" the traffic on any network  and it's often possible to add or ""inject"" unwelcome traffic as well. However  some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. For both wired and wireless networks alike  the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?Wireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable  wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.Network engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. The practice of wardriving  for example  exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.Overall  conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now ""secure enough"" to use in the vast majority of homes  and  many businesses. Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or ""encrypt"" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. Likewise  wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.Obviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. The better a wireless network is administered  the more secure it becomes. However  the only truly secure network is the one never built!"

680,why electrical appliances' plugs are not the same all over the world? Which one would be the best?,The basic reason they're different is because countries preferred alternate designs  there never was an effort to standardize  and carrying devices between countries was much less common at the time the plugs were designed.The modern British 3-pin design (BS 1363) is one of the best.  It's quite safe for several reasons:--Insulation around the base of the prongs  so even small fingers cannot touch the metal of the prongs when unplugging.--Shutters on the live and neutral socket openings that are opened by the ground pin--A built in fuse in the plug itself--Switches on the outletsHowever  the plug is quite large and sometimes difficult for the elderly to handle.  Also  stepping on one barefooted is a bit painful (prongs are not rounded!)
681,When you buy a woman a bottled water at the bar  do you also bring her a glass?,I think it depends on the type of woman for whom you are buying the bottled water. If you see her sucking on a Budweiser long neck  she might be offended if offered a glass. On the other hand if she's ordering drinks with umbrellas in them  she might appreciate the glass. One caveat  if you offer her a glass  it will make it easier for her to throw the water in your face if you make a wrong move. Without the glass you'll just get the bottle dumped on your head ; )
682,Is it legal to publicly rate medical doctors?,NOT LEGAL ADVICE:As long as you make it clear that you are offering your opinion  then your ratings will be protected by the US Constitution's 1st Amendment protection for free speech. (You are in the US  right?)If you falsely or misleadingly indicate that your rankings are based on something other than your opinion  then there may be liability for libel or even fraud.  However  if the rankings are based on some criteria other than your opinion  and you are explicit about the basis for the rankings and truthful about the results  you are similarly protected.Shouldn't be a difference for medical or mechanical rankings. But  keep in mind that if people rely on your endorsement and then something goes wrong  they may seek to hold you liable.  The best protection against this is to be explicit about your sources (opinion  etc.) and have a lawyer advise you.Good luck!

684,What makes a teacher want to leave their profession?,It seems like a lot of factors contribute to teacher attrition (leaving the profession). But apparently new teachers are most likely to abandon ship.According to a 1986 survey  more than 2/3 of all beginning teachers will have left during their first four years of teaching and 40-50% of them will leave during the first seven years of their career. (Huling-Austin  1986).These are some factors likely most likely to affect the attrition of new teachers:1) Beginning teachers are unable to cope with teaching problems like discipline  difficulties with parents  and lack of sufficient or appropriate teaching materials.2) Beginners are often given the most difficult teaching assignments.3) Novice teachers often receive little or no support after leaving the university and find that their teacher education programs ill-prepared them for the realities of teaching.Other factors  such as salary  affect attrition rates  but perhaps the fact that beginning teachers lack adequate support and resources to handle such a large responsibility (basically parenting your students) is where the responsbility lies.
685,what is the best lap top to get with reasonable price?,I've had mostly Toshiba's for the past five years  they are rock solid reliable.  Check out Amazon to skip taxes and shipping.  You can also add Toshiba support to a laptop you bought on Amazon  their tech's are great.The few HP's I've worked with (including my Yahoo! work laptop) seem very feature rich  but I've never owned one long enough to determine how reliable they are.  HP does seem to be hitting the street hard this Christmas season with low prices; they had a Black Friday special laptop for $400 at Wal-Mart.  Their screens also seem very crisp and high resolution  there's definately a sexy factor.I like the look and pricing of the new Dells  but my IT admin friends have had plenty of problems with older Dell keyboards breaking  so I'd make sure to add a service plan to your Dell if you're comparison shopping the price.
686,Would it make me a bad friend if I don't lend my friend money when she needs it?,If she's a crack addict and needs money for her Saturday night hit  then no  you wouldn't be a bad friend by refusing.It depends if you trust your friend. If she's a very responsible person but has just fallen on hard times and is about to lose her house  then yea  maybe you should lend the money.
687,Where did Calvin and Hobbes get their names?,"They are named after French theology John Calvin and English philosopher Thomas Hobbes.  Calvin believed that only a subset of humanity (the ""elect"") would be saved  and that this was predestined  regardless of their actions.  Hobbes is famous for saying that human life is ""nasty  brutish  and short.""    Bill Watterson  the cartoonist who created Calvin and Hobbes  mentions something about his choice of the names in the introduction to one of the published collections of his comic strips.  In particular  he says that the tiger Hobbes shares the philosopher's low opinion of human nature."
688,How do I tone my butt? What's the best exercise for butts?,"Where do you live?  I have been taking a class called ""Core Fusion"" for almost a year now  and it has been the most effective thing I've done in terms of toning my body up (all over  not just butt).  It is offered at Exhale Spa  which has locations in Boston  New York  Chicago  Venice (CA) and Santa Monica - and I believe they'll be opening up a Dallas location in 2006.If you are not near an Exhale  yoga has a lot of postures that will help you tone your butt muscles (maybe check out a local gym or studio?).  So does Pilates (which I'm not really a fan of - I find it boring).There are also the old ""standbys"" of squats and lunges (you can get added benefit by integrating props or machines - i.e. do the lunges or squats on the Smith Machine - the one that has the bar with adjustable weights that you square on the back of your shoulders while doing the exercises  or stand with your back to the wall  place a physioball behind you and roll it up and down the wall with your back as you squat).  One important thing to remember about squats and lunges is not to let your knees go forward of your ankles - that puts a lot of strain on your knees and sets you up for unpleasant injuries.If you go to the gym  some of the weight machines they should have can be effective butt toners - like the leg/hamstring curl machines."
689,"Can I use 26"" mountain bike rims for my cyclocross-frame bike?","The 26"" wheels won't work. They're slightly smaller in diameter than a 700c wheel–that's what cyclocross frames are built to take. Back in the late 80's/early 90's you could get clamp-on cantilever brake mounts from Moots  but I don't know that they make those anymore. And regardless  if you were to do that  you'd also be dropping the overall height of your bike. This in turn would mean that your bottom bracket would also be lower to the ground. That's counterproductive in terms of cyclocross applications  where you want a higher bottom bracket than you would on a road bike (for clearence issues).There's some good general information on equipment on Dave Carr's Cross Page (listed below). Good luck!"

691,Why are Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie fighting?,Rumor has it that after Paris was on SNL she threw a party to watch it  Nicole took the SNL tape and replaced it with her sex video. Neither one of the girls have confirmed this though.
692,"Is it rude not to say ""bless you"" when someone sneezes?","I started using ""bless you"" after I moved to the US  but really I think it's an unecessary left-over from olden days when it was used to ward off probable death for those unfortunate enough to have sneeze-diseases like influenza. However  not saying ""excuse me"" when you sneeze - or shortly thereafter - is inexcusable.I grew up in a country where saying ""bless you"" is optional for the sneezee  but ""excuse me"" is mandatory for the sneezer. Not so in the USA  in my experience. I've never heard an American say ""excuse me"" after sneezing  even though they have just sprayed me and everyone else with all those evil  influenza-inducing vibes. That was tolerable in the past  but with this H5N1 Avian flu threat  I've been getting mighty worked up every time I'm sneezed at. I'm thinking of dropping ""bless you"" in favor of ""bless me."""
693,How can teachers  parents and administrators improve test scores for middle school children?,I believe the best answer to your question is less obvious than what happens in the classroom or at home while children are in the process of learning.  We (meaning the US) have gone a little bit overboard in trying to quantify academic progress  although some measurement is valuable.  It's just been corrupted in recent years for political purposes to convince us we're making progress in how we stack up nationally.  In any case  I'd suggest getting students at ease in the standardized test taking environment.  Give them some experience before test days with time constraints and answer grids.  For goodness sake  don't make a test seem like the whole future of the school district is dependent on their performance!  Talk about test anxiety!  Perhaps counselors have a role too in helping students who appear to be stressed by the experience with a few relaxation techniques.  Your mind works like a file system  and the lower the stress  the more you are able to recall from the material that you actually do know.

698,what is the best way to get a car door dent fixed?,"Depends on the size of the dent.  If the dent is small (like the size of a half dollar) and there is no paint damage  the best option is paintless dent removal  do a search on the maps beta for ""paintless dent removal"" in your area and you can see where the shops are.  (see link).PDR is much cheaper than normal methods  I've paid around $50/dent and been very satisfied with the results."
699,How many words with 10 letters are there in the US dictionary?,"SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists) has about 70 000 10-letter words total.  If we limit it to the ""large"" subset recommended for spellchecking in the U.S.  it's about 20 000 10-letter words.  If we then remove proper names  capitalized words  abbreviations  contractions  and possessives  it's about 14 000 words (from ""abandoning"" to ""zygodactyl"").Scrabble dictionaries usually have considerably fewer 10-letter words  because they remove words that can't be formed in normal gameplay.  The one I have lists about 50 10-letter words."

703,What is emo?,Emo is a genre of music  as well as a lifestyle.  It is most popular in the 14-19 age group.    The music is generally about a boy who is either angry  depressed  or crying over an ex-girlfriend who supposedely ruined his life.    The style of clothing associated with this scene involves:  tight jeans  sneakers  a shirt that means nothing (i.e. a construction company)  and hair that is long and matted down to the head.  Eyeliner is also common for boys.    Examples include: Story of the Year  Yellowcard  My Chemical Romance  Brand New  Thursday  and others.

705,What is panna cotta?,Panna cotta means cooked cream in Italian and is very similar in consistency to a custard or flan but without the eggs. Typically it's served with fruit  syrup  or honey. One of my favorite recipes courtesy of Eric Ripert's Return to Cooking:Buttermilk Panna Cotta with GrapefruitMakes 4 servingsPreparation Time: 15 minutesCooking Time: 35 minutes  plus 4 hours chilling timeIngredients:1 1/4 cup heavy cream3/4 cup sugar1 package granulated gelatin1 3/4 cups buttermilkVegetable oil cooking spray3 large pink grapefruit1 teaspoon vanilla extract2 tablespoons Vermont honey (or substitute another honey)Method:1. Bring the cream and sugar to a boil and cook until the sugar has melted. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Combine the gelatin and buttermilk. Once the cream has cooled  add the buttermilk-gelatin mixture and stir to combine.2. Spray four (6-ounce) ramekins with vegetable spray. Divide the buttermilk-cream mixture between the ramekins and cover with plastic wrap. Chill until set  at least 4 hours or overnight.3. Meanwhile  cut off the ends of the grapefruit. Using the tip of your knife  cut the peel and pith from the grapefruit. Hold the grapefruit over a bowl to catch the juice and cut out the segments from the fruit. Squeeze the membrane to release all the grapefruit juice. Refrigerate the grapefruit segments. Place the grapefruit juice (you should have at least 1 cup) in a small pot and add the vanilla extract. Bring to a boil and reduce by one third  about 30 minutes . Set aside.4. To serve  dip the ramekins in hot water for 3 seconds. Run a thin knife around the edge of each ramekin and invert it onto the center of a plate. Arrange the grapefruit segments around the panna cotta in a spiraling fashion. Spoon the sauce over the grapefruit and drizzle the honey over the sauce. Serve immediately.

710,Which part-time MBA program will add value to a software developer with 15 years experience?,Wow.  There are some pretty negative answers in this thread.Pick a good program.  Pick a highly rated program.  The brand *is* part of the value of an MBA  and frankly  the lower rated programs aren't that much cheaper.  Here in the Bay Area  Haas (Berkeley) has a great ranking (top 5 in part time rankings  recently been in the top 10 for full time).  I am currently a student at Haas (in the PT program)  and I can't understand why people would pick a different program in this region.  Stanford  unfortunately  doesn't have a part time program.I agree with the previous poster who said you need to have an idea what you want out of it.  Go in with a plan on how you're going to get value from the MBA  and just from being a student.  I'm amazed at the access I get just by being an MBA student.  It opens a lot of doors.  But you need to be very goal directed to get this value.I can't agree with the person who said networking in a PT program isn't good.  As a current PT student  I have an *amazing* network of rising stars at a number of bay area companies  right now.  Comparing notes with some co-workers who are recent graduates from the FT programs at Wharton  Stanford  Columbia  it's clear that my network is broader  more active  and more useful right now than their networks.So - to your actual question.  If you are in the Bay Area  pick Berkeley (I'm biased  obviously).  Really  you can gain a lot of value from any part time MBA program.  But talk to people  figure out how *you* can gain value from an MBA  and then go from there.
711,Why do people put salt around the glass when drinking Margarita?,"Salt is traditionally added to the rim of the glass to provide a sharp contrast in flavor to better experience the drink as a whole.The difference in the salt and the sugar content in the alcohol helps to stimulate all of your tastebuds  which are divided into sectors based on the type of sensation.Take caution to not over-salt the rim of the glass and thus coat only the outside portion of the rim around 1/4""... getting salt on the inside of the glass risks modifying the flavor of the drink."
712,What's a good new Myst-type game?,Myst V: End of Ages (PC)was just released this year.You might want to try that out?
713,Why is Lost so popular?,"I was much more into it the first season. I think the combination of mystery/sci-fi aspects (which tends to get people pretty engrossed) with fairly effective storytelling (and cliffhanger) tactics  makes it popular. Why did people keep watching 'Gilligan's Island'? At least in part it had to be to see if they'd ever get off the island (well  at least it was a plot point in almost every episode!). With Lost  it's the same  but more ""serious"".There is a strong numerology thread running through the first season at least  and that was intriguing to me personally (although I don't ""believe in"" numerology  I thought it was a fascinating device.)There was some amount of in-built fanbase too  as the guy who created Alias (JJ Abrams)  also created Lost.Oh  and a lot of people seem to be into it for reasons they're into a lot of other shows--good looking people in skimpy/wet/sweaty clothes!"

715,Where can I find great ramen in San Francisco?,I would recommend Iroha in Japan Town. Besides ramen  soba and katsu curry are my favourites. :)
716,Any family doctor recommendations near Campbell/Los Gatos CA?,We've been happy with Joe Morgensen (adults) and Donald and Laura Stemmle (pediatrics)  all three of whom are affiliated with and have offices near Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Gatos.  (My wife very much likes Mary Imig for ob/gyn  too.)All four participate in Aetna PPO/EPO plans  for what it's worth.
717,What is CGI?,Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is an important World Wide Web technology that enables a client web browser to request data from a program executed on the Web server. CGI specifies a standard for passing data between the client and the program.An aim of CGI is to be language-neutral  though Perl is often associated with it.
718,What is the best Christmas present you can give your spouse/partner?,Try not to buy gifts but make/write something yourself. She would be delighted if she could get something hand-made by you. :) Simply a home-made greeting card  a photo ornament (with you&her photo)  a personalized tee  etc.
719,Whats a good place to eat in LA?,If you are thinking sushi then i'd hit either:R23 - If you are going for the 'king of secret hipster' spots this place is it.  In downtown LA  off the beaten path and the food is great. You should be able to get out for under $100.Sushi Roku - There are a couple one near the beverly center  one near the 3rd street walk in Santa Monica both feature great quality sushi  good service and great people watching.
720,Are humans still evolving?,Evolution is ever-present as always. You could argue it's rate is a function of environment change. So to answer what's driving human evolution you need to look at the human environment as part of the equation. Extreme evolution happens when an organism's environment changes and it cannot escape it. As a previous post mentioned  humans now have the ability to easily move around the world and escape a 'bad' environment. So evolution may indeed have slowed  but it is not dead. Some cataclysmic change affecting the whole planet  if it doesn't kill the species completely  will certainly speed up the evolutionary process when you compare the human race a few generations either side of said event.Given that evolution is the result of genetic mutation/favoritism during sexual reproduction are we seeing those more desirable for sex setting the evolutionary path while environment change is minimized by our ability to control it or escape it?Is average height an example of this? It would certainly seem that humans are growing taller on average  and what western (cultural bias) woman does not want a tall mate for example. It should be noted however that who we think is desirable for sex is very culturally dependent and may not lead to the best long-term (breeding) prospects for an individual conceived to those parents.

722,what is a double layer DVD burner?,Movie DVDs you buy in the store can contain up to 8.5 gigabytes of data.  This is because they are pressed (as opposed to burned) dual-layer DVDs (also called DVD-9).  The recordable DVD+-Rs that have been on the market for a while a single-layer DVD-5s and can store  up to 4.7 gigabytes.  This disrepency is why programs that copy movie DVDs need to compress the DVD content after unencrypting it before they can be burned to a normal DVD.  Recently new DVD burners and media were introduced that allowed people to burn DVD-9 DVDs reasonably affordably.So a double-layer DVD burner is one that is capable of burning 8.5 gigabyte DVD-9 format DVDs.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd#Technical_information
723,What is a stable and high return investment?,Hi Consider investing broad index funds which are quite safe  and would have return in 10% range over period of 5-10 years. Consider funds like VTI  VXF  SPY and there are many others  you can research on finance.yahoo.com.Thanks -- Devendra
724,Why does Amazon try to patent everything?,"Amazon  like other companies  tries to patent its innovations for two reasons:1.  To gain a competitive advantage by excluding competitors from using its new ideas.  For example  Amazon once sued Barnes and Noble over a patent.2.  To discourage competitors from filing patent infringement suits against Amazon.  This concept is sometimes called ""Mutually Assured Destruction"".The idea that Amazon or other companies are patenting existing or obvious ideas is incorrect.  It's an urban legend fueled by people's unwillingness to read and understand the patents.  The USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) only grants patents on techniques that are *novel* and *non-obvious*.You can look up any granted US patent on the USPTO website  and roughly evaluate it by reading the broadest independent claim  which is usually claim #1.  Remember  to infringe the claim  you have to have all the elements of the claim.Generally  the claims are narrower (less powerful) than people think.Do they have a legal leg to stand on?  Once a patent is gratned by the USPTO  it has roughly a 50% chance of being upheld if brought to court."
725,Must have camping gear?,Depending on the kind of camping you/hubby/both are interested in  the following gear is useful:1. headlamp - a flashlight that is worn on the head  thereby freeing your hands (for cooking at night  or hiking before dawn  or finishing a walk after dusk). There are many brands  choose one within your budget (or what is on sale)2. tent - depending on whether for hike-camping or car-camping  you'd want different weight/size/material (and that will determine the price)3. sleeping bag - weight/material will depend on whether it's intended for warm-weather camping only  or 4 seasons (and that will determine price)Then  depending on the style of camping  you may wish to consider:- type of backpack- cooking stove- cooking pots/pans- waterfilter- water bottles/camelback- map holders (waterproof?)- compass/GPSThat's enough to start Christmas shopping with...
726,Anyone have a recommendation for an investment brokerage in Seattle?,I highly recommend Ryan Sawyer at Merrill Lynch -- I worked with him at Amazon.com for several years  and he is generally regarded as one of the most honest and friendly (and incredibly intelligent) people you'll ever meet.
727,Does anyone know a good apartment rental agency around Washington DC?,I've had personal experience with Archstone apartments and Summit (just bought by Camden) apartments in the past two years. While neither one is stellar  both were acceptable. Both of these were in the Northern Virginia area - bedroom communities for D.C.Best of luck apartment hunting! The housing market around here is absolutely insane.
728,"Why does ""The New Yorker"" use tremas in words like ""coöperation""?",It seems to be a stylistic holdover from an era when that usage was more prevalent (about the 1930s/1940s). The New Yorker has a highly entrenched writing style that has been rigorously enforced over the years. (For example  there was a staff Grammarian who overlooked much of the copy editing for over fifty years; see the below article for details.)In short  the writing style/voice has become as much a trademark of the magazine as its cartoons  and will most likely not be changing much in the foreseeable future.
729,Field mouse loose in my house.  Sticky traps failed. Know any other kid-friendly methods?,"Wow. Sticky traps aren't really that kid friendly  unless you were planning on letting little Billy hang on to a shaved mouse with awfully tender paws and tail.There are a number of ""humane"" traps for various vermin  but remember that rodents are actually pretty crafty little buggers able to do some fairly amazing things. (e.g. they have a vertical jump of around 3-4 feet  and can squeeze themselves through openings far smaller than you suspect they could.)If you do decide to go for a humane trap  there are a couple of things you should keep in mind:1) Unless you find out how he got in  there's no stopping him from coming back. Even if you don't plan on laying mouse death around the house  get an experienced exterminator in to help you identify where to patch up.2) Mice will find their way back. Dumping them in the backyard isn't really enough. Best to find a location two or three miles (no kidding) away  certainly with your house well out of view. (Know anyone across town that could use some company?)Good luck!"
730,Does anyone know a comics collectible shop in the area?,Try the following shop:Dreamland Comics1451 W Schaumburg Rd  Schaumburg  IL(847) 524-6060
731,How do you negotiate a job offer?,At the point you have a job offer  you are in the best position to negotiate.  This is because they have already spent the money to get all the way through the recruiting process  and if they were to start again from scratch it might cost them an additional 20-50k to bring a different candidate into the position.  Add to this the cost to the project of having an unfilled position for a longer period than expected  and you'll find there is a pretty large margin for you to negotiate where their net costs will be lower if they acquiese to your requests.The other factor is the overall job market.  In today's market  where employment is picking up in many sectors you're in a good spot to negotiate.Now the right place to phrase things is to describe competitive offers (hopefully you'll have some) in terms of their relative advantage.  If one of your alternative offers pays more  you can allude to this vaguely.  Even if they do not  you can allude to the relative advantages (the types of challenge  the convience of the commute etc).  This will create a more competitive landscape where your potential employer feels like they need to overcome other offers (and not that you are simply greedy and would like more cash).Unless the potential employer has really lowballed you (i.e. you are well below industry averages for your area)  you should shoot for a modest counter-proposal of 5-15%.  Put this out there with clear timelines for when they need to respond  and other forms you might accept (signing bonus  trading-up level/rank  etc).You should stay professional throughout the process  even if your offer is rejected.  Employers know that this is the right time to bring these things up  so don't worry about burning bridges by putting a request out there at this stage.Ok.  Hope that helps!
732,I'm going to Korea this Christmas. What type of clothing is good to wear in Korea?,A parka is light  warm  and stylish. It would be a great choice if you plan to walk around in the cold weather and look good too:http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=9002&pid=315701&scid=315701012

734,Where does the sidewalk end?,That depends on several things:1) Which sidewalk?2) Where do you WANT it to end?3) Where do I want it to end and4) Where does IT want to end?
735,What's a better car  a Camry or an Accord?,The Accord.  Objectively the Accord just won the comparison test in the latest Car and Driver (camry came in last)  and subjectively Honda is a much more innovative and interesting company than Toyota.  For instance  the Accord has a racing derived double wishbone suspension at all four corners  resulting in a car with sharper handling than the camry. The Accord has also been mildly restyled for 2006  which in my opinion is a BIG improvement over the previous model.The gauges in the honda are electroluminiscent  which is immediately apparent when starting the car.  The keys are RFID encoded to prevent theft.  The navigation system is voice activated and one of the best on the market.  THere really is no comparison between the two.Of course  drive them both  but the innovation is clearly with Honda in this comparison.
736,How much does it cost to own a private jet?,Well   it is really depends on what is the size of it and what features you want it to have internally.  The variety is huge  and so is the price rangeA new jet will be between 10 to 100 million  but an older one might be less then 10.So  in order to answer it- we need more details
737,Is there anywhere that rents UMD movies for PSP?,GameFly.com rents both PSP movies and games.  (They're in seperate categories if you don't see them right away.)I've been a customer for about a year  and I think their selection and customer service are both stellar.  Ship times seem a little longer than Netflix  and pricing is higher (for good reason).I love the packaging (in addition to the Netflix style paper envelopes there's a hard cardboard shield) and I've never received a defective game.  The pre-owned purchase program is also a nice touch.
738,What does .com stand for?,".com stands for ""commercial.""  This is used by commercial websites but anyone can buy a domain name that ends in .com even if it is not going to be used commercially."
739,Travel safety for women?,Get to know the countries you're travelling to  particularly local customs such as how women are expected to dress and behave. Respecting those customs will help take you a long way towards gaining respect in return as a foreigner.I also found it very helpful to read current travel boards such as Thorntree by Lonely Planet to find up-to-date information about everything  including safety.If you're considering a country with poor tourist infrastructure or one where you don't think you'd be comfortable travelling alone  a tour can be great. Small groups that focus on using local resources can give you the best of both worlds...you make new friends and your plans are taken care of  but it doesn't feel like a standard canned bus tour. One example (from a good personal experience) is Intrepid Tours (http://www.intrepidtravel.com/).Also  ping your friends to see if they know anyone in the countries you want to visit. They might be very willing give you great tips  show you around  or even provide a place to stay. I planned a 6-month solo trip that ended up with friends of friends doing just that in some of the destinations I was most nervous about!
740,What are the worst cigarettes you can smoke?,black death cigarettes  or so they claim  which is refreshing honesty for a tobacco company.especially if you break off the filter :)
741,Who to start on defense this week?,I would go Pittsburg. Polamalu is almost guaranteed at least 2 interceptions against Palmer.
742,If you could choose  would you want your kid to be smart but mean  or dumb and kind?,Basically  this question tells more about the person who answers it than it does give any sensible answer.I'd prefer smart and mean. For this reason: if my kid is really going to be smart  (s)he'll sooner or later learn that being mean will fall back on you.Sure  you get through life a lot easier if you care nothing about hurting others...but the higher you climb  the deeper you drop - and being on top doesn't mean you're happy within.A smart kid  though  will not be afraid to look inside and learn her fears  work to overcome them and find something that makes her happy. Given the human trait of striving for acknowledgement from others  kindness will follow gradually.
743,Do you believe teachers are recognized enough for their efforts?,No  Not at all.
744,What was the name of King Arthur's sword?,Excalibur
745,Are we safe from terrorist attacks?  Is the homeland security effective?,"It all depends on your definition of ""safe"". For example  if you consider yourself ""safe"" when you are driving down the road  then you are also ""safe"" from terrorist attacks.About 40 000 people die in the U.S. yearly from car accidents.As far as airline security goes  two things which have been done have made the airlines more secure:1. Securing the cockpit with stronger doors and restrictions on opening them2. The knowledge of airline crew and passengers that they should fight back against hijackers rather than letting them control the plane."

747,I suspect a mole or gopher is digging up my garden. How can I tell which it is  and what can I do about it?,Moles and gophers can be distinguished by the types of tunnels they create. Since the moles' tunnels are visible atop the ground  they are the easier to identify of the two. Mole hills are circular with an exit hole in the middle  while gopher mounds are fan-shaped with an off-center hole.What you can do about it largely depends upon the state in which you live.  On my friend's ranch in Montana  we went target shooting.  Seriously though  the supplied link offers several solutions.  Good luck.
748,Why do people shop only after Thanksgiving?,The day after Thanksgiving marks the start of the Christmas shopping season.  People get into the spirit of Christmas after Thanksgiving.People love sales. Shopping the day after Thanksgiving and the day after Christmas is like a tradition.  It's one of the days when retail stores make a big profit.For some people  they don't want to wait. They want to start early and get a better gift selection.  They don't want to get up at 6am and wait in line.I am a last minute shopper.  I get better deals two days before Christmas day.  The stores I usually go to offer 20% off on items that have been previously marked down 40% or 50%.
749,Does Preparation H really reduce the appearance of cellulites?,I heard models use preparation H.  You apply Preparation H on your thighs and wrap it with saran wrap.  You could also apply it under your eyes to reduce eye bags.
750,Why can't I get used to console-style controls in FPS games?,I suggest going back to your computer for FPS. Console controls are not well-suited to FPS style gameplay. The only console that will truly be able to pull this off well is the Nintendo Revolution (which will come out next year).
751,Will there be a third kill bill?,"there have been widespread rumors about Tarantino's desire to revisit the character of the Bride in a third installment. most of these stemmed from an interview published in Entertainment Weekly  in which Quentin expressed his desire to revisit the Bride in 15 years:    ""The star will be Vernita Green's (Vivica A. Fox's) daughter  Nikki (Ambrosia Kelley). I've already got the whole mythology: Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus) will get all of Bill's money. She'll raise Nikki  who'll take on The Bride "" he says. ""Nikki deserves her revenge every bit as much as The Bride deserved hers. I might even shoot a couple of scenes for it now so I can get the actresses while they're this age.""    Tarantino's idea is an excellent one  and in tune with the ambitious nature of the Kill Bill project itself. however  it is important to note that Tarantino is well known for announcing interest in projects that could never see the light of day  so there is no certainty that this will come about."
752,How do you classify music into genres?,"Genres are pretty much entirely made up  and tend to change over time.  They're like tagging on flickr or myweb  before the tagging concept became popular.As a DJ  my own thought process tends to be that I'll see words in reviews  and often (though not always) eventually come to understand what the reviewers are trying to say with those words.  If I like the music associated with those words  I can have some minor expectation that I might enjoy other music with similar words.Unfortunately  this has led me to purchase some really awful stuff -- for example  one reviewer I used to like a lot used the term ""electrofunk"" to refer to music that wasn't any of the three or four things called ""electro "" and wasn't funky."
753,Which player led the USA Basketball team (original Dream Team) in scoring in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona?,Charles Barkley with 144 points (18.0 avg).
754,is there an add-on sirius unit for my existing car stereo that doesn't use an FM modulator?,Depends on your factory stereo.  If it has cd changer controls there is a chance you can use an aux input adapter  but if you already have a cd changer you can't have both the adapter and the input.  See the link for a list.  I believe all sirius units have a line output  even the ones that have FM modulators  so you should be ok with your current unit.
755,Is it okay to go to a guy's place on the first date?,No  it's too soon.
756,When is the next season of 24?,Look for 24 to return in January with a 4 hour 2part season premiere:Sunday January 15  2006 and Monday January 16  2006I think FOX does this to have more original programming on the air year round.  Since a normal tv season usually only contains about 24 episodes  they used to have to fill the rest of the year with reruns.  By giving 24 a late start  you should get more consecutive new episodes with less reruns in between which helps keep people actively watching week after week.Currently the FOX drama Prison Break airs in 24's place and it is having its fall season finale next monday to make way for 24's return in January.
757,Where in the world is Carmen San Diego?,Apparently  she is in Cairo  Egypt.http://googlefoundcarmensandiego.ytmnd.com/
758,why does a person's allergies change over time?,"Why is the big question.  I noticed that at age 35 I began to experience an allergic reaction to melons  bananas  raw carrots and a few other foods.  It is quite frustrating because I have enjoyed those foods my entire life...until now.  I went to my allergist  who is one of the leading asthma and allergy doctors in the country.  He said that is is  unfortately  common for adults to develop new allergies at different points in life.  The big question is ""why""  and at this point  doctors have no idea why some people develop new allergies and others do not."
759,Why are blueberries so good for your health?,Blueberries are high in anti-oxidants. Also  they are low in saturated fat  cholesterol and sodium. They are a good source of dietary fiber  vitamins C and K and manganese.
760,is batman stronger then spiderman?,in mere strength alone  Spider-man has the beloved Batman bested as the radioactive spider that bit Peter Parker not only equipped him with powers similar to that of a spider but superhuman strength as well. since Batman is human and does not contain superhuman strength  and the question is worded in such a way as to question and compare strength alone  the winner would have to be Spider-man.    however  had the question intended to pit Spidey against Batman  one on one  in a fight to the finish  that remains a bit stickier. i'd have to put my money on Batman because knowing Bruce Wayne  he would not engage Spidey without taking full advantage of studying up on his enemy and exploiting his every weakness. that's just my two cents.
761,What is the average price for a BMW?,"it depends on which bimmer you want. new or used? these are new car prices. the following are the ""starting at"" prices for the different series bimmers and don't include any options and all those other charges you get stuck with.3 series $30 900-$44 9005 series $42 500-$57 4006 series $71 800-$78 8007 series $71 800-$118 900X3 SAV   $36 800X5 SAV   $42 500-$71 100Z4       $34 800-$41 800M series $48 900-$81 200 (doesn't include M6)"
762,Can a parent be a child's best friend?,I've seen cases where the parent is the child's best friend and vice-versa. Usually it is a mother and daughter. It never seems very healthy. There tends to be a lot of oversharing on the mother's part and normal healthy boundaries are not observed.  They lean very heavily on each other to the exclusion of others outside the relationship.To answer your question  yes a parent can be a child's best friend  but it is not usually in either of their best interests if this is the case.
763,Where is a good place to meet a guy I met on the internet?,Somewhere public  in case he turns out to be a weirdo. Also  a cafe instead of a restaurant  in case you need to make a quick exit.
764,Why should I purchase a Lexus over a Mercedes and BMW?,The Lexus is a car for people who don't really like cars.  They want cars to be comfortable  safe  cheap to own (particularly when you factor in depreciation)  and high quality.  In other words  if you view a car as an appliance and you just want it to do its job in as unobtrusive a way as possible  get the Lexus.  They are trying to change this with their new models  but change comes slowly.Mercedes-Benz cars are typically less luxurious and arguably built to a lower standard.  They are filled with cutting-edge technology (Lexus is usually a couple years behind) and are quite enjoyable to drive  and are just as safe.  They are also not quite as reliable  and they depreciate more quickly.  Buy a Mercedes if you want luxury but also enjoy driving.  If you really enjoy driving and don't mind a firmer ride  get a BMW.
765,What was the name of The Jetsons' robot maid?,Rosie
766,In Paris  is it worth it to purchase a museum pass or should I just pay individually?,Totally worth it  at least for the restrooms.  :)The museum pass doesn't get you in to absolutely everything (that'd be another good q&a)  but it gets you in to most everything.  Additionally  it lets you skip the line to buy tickets in a lot of places - for example  we got to skip the line at Versailles  St. Chappelle  and Musee d'Orsay.It's also pretty nice to be able to go into (almost) any museum  if even for a brief while.  We had a nice time spending a few hours in d'Orsay  then going to the Rodin museum for an hour  Invalides for 30 minutes  so on.  It's nice that you can go sample  a lot of different places  at least briefly.And  honestly  sometimes you go into the museum just to find a good restroom.
767,Should I buy Xbox or wait for PS3??,"It all really depends on what you're looking for. A lot of people will tell you that the PS3 will have more games  which was the case with the PS2 and the Xbox. However  the Xbox represented Microsoft's first real foray into console gaming  so many developers were reluctant to get on board.However  after seeing the success of the Xbox combined with a 6-month (at least) headstart on Sony's next-gen console  and the incredible support that Microsoft offers its game development community  many more developers are signing on with the Xbox 360; particularly Japanese developers  which was a shortcoming with Microsoft's previous console.But really it comes down to what you're looking for. A lot of people will say that if you're looking for RPGs  you should go with the PS3  citing the PS2 as last generation's reigning RPG king in console gaming. Truly  it's a matter of preference. If you prefer Western-style RPGs like Morrowind  or Knights of the Old Republic  the 360 will offer a great deal more than the PS3. Even if you're looking for Eastern-style RPGs (i.e.  Final Fantasy and such)  you may want to look again. While the Xbox got little love from Japan's premier RPG developers  Square-Enix  the Xbox 360 is seeing a great deal of support coming from them.But then again  you've got the exclusive-title to consider. The Xbox 360 offers Halo 3  Perfect Dark Zero  among others. The PS3 has Metal Gear Solid 4  Devil May Cry  and more. So  it really comes down to what you're looking for.Still  the fact remains that Microsoft is a great deal more supportive of its developers  keeping the architecture simple and providing tools to make game production more efficient and cost-effective. On the otherhand  the PS3's technology is proving cumbersome and expensive (Source: http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/9503/Developers-Migrating-from-PS3-to-Xbox-360-Development/). This may also effect what games appear on what console.Technologically speaking  the two consoles are pretty evenly matched  though the PS3 has a leg up in some areas. The biggest advantage for the PS3 is the support of BluRay technology. This will allow developers to fit larger games on to the disc and increase performance. However  BluRay hasn't taken hold yet  and it's entirely possible that it won't become popular.The PS3 supports seven players  while the 360 supports four. So  if you're a social gamer  you may want to take that into account. Me? I can't stand split-screen.My biggest deciding factor is online support. The Xbox 360 will come with Xbox Live support. It's a tried and proven platform  and Microsoft has demonstrated that they have the saavy to provide a stable  user-friendly online experience. Plus  the service will only improve. Sony has said little to nothing about its online plans. So  if you're looking for massive online support  then the 360 is the clear winner. If you're still leaning towards the PS3  you'll have to wait for Sony to elaborate on any online plans they might have.In the end  I would say don't listen to me  or anyone else that happens to post an answer to this question. Hardcore gamers who take the time to answer this type of question  you'll find  are perhaps some of the most opinonated people you'll encounter on the web. We tend to be diehard supporters of our console of choice  and will often stop at nothing to sway anyone who will ""listen"" to our point of view.So  the answer you're looking for is this: Hit the web and do some research. Find out for yourself what each system has to offer and make your decision. If you need a few good sites to use for these purposes  I recommend the following:www.ign.comwww.gamespot.comwww.gamespy.com"
768,"What is the meaning behind the song ""the reflex"" by Duran Duran?","From the sourced website:""The Reflex""  Duran DuranI  being a HUGE Duran Duran fan  can shed some light on this song. Back in the 80's when I had the word book for the album and meanings  this song simply was about a person being on stage  forgetting words and making them up as he went along. Take for instance ""I'm on a ride and I want to get off/but they won't slow down around the bout  I sold the Renoir and the tv set/don't want to be around when this gets out"". Hope this can shed some light that not all Duran Duran songs are about sex."

772,As a novice runner  how many weeks/months do I need to properly train for a marathon?,"The answer  of course  varies for each individual depending on how fit you are  how often do you train and what your goals are.If you are very aggressive  you can do it in 28 weeks. Start by walking  slowly  for amile. Two days later  walk 1.5 miles. Every other day  increase the distance by half a mile until you get to 3 miles. Rest your muscles on the ""off"" day. Hold that distance on Tuesday and Thursday  while increasing by one additional mile on your weekend session (either Sat or Sun).Once the long walk reaches 10 miles you can cut the distance in half every other weekend  increasing the long one by 2 miles each time. When the long onegets to 18 miles  you can do it every third weekend  covering 8-9 miles on the ""short"" weekends.After about the third week of training  insert a one min jog into your runs  after 4 min of walking. If this feels fine after 2 weeks  drop to 3walk/1jog. After 3 more weeks  drop to 2-1. If all goes well after another 3 weeks or so you could go to 1-1 during the week  and 2walk/1jog on the long run.Find the ratio that works best for you  that will leave you feeling strong at the end  and recovering fast from these long ones. The pace for all ofthese should be very  very slow."

774,How to raise a lobster?,Lobsters are scavengers  so they'll eat whatever's on the bottom of the tank. That includes algae  snails  and dead fish.You can feed a baby lobster fish flakes  and shrimp pellets to adults.More great care and feeding advice in the website below.
775,Which religion is the right one?,"None.  There is no God.Religion is a primitive attempt at understanding how the world works. It has been completely replaced by the Scientific Method  which is the greatest discovery of all time.There is no more evidence for the existence of God than there is for the existence of leprechauns. Better to spend our time enjoying our wonderful world and helping our fellow beings instead of arguing about which brand of imaginary supernatural friend is the ""right one""."
776,How can I cure my hiccups?,This is to expand on another person's answer  which was correct but missing some important steps or explanation.  This cure is a bonafide medical and scientific cure.  The get rid of hiccups  you must deprive oxygen from the muscle that is causing hiccups. No oxygen to that muscle  it can't burn energy  no energy  no hiccups.So what needs to be done is to simulate DROWNING.  We must trick the body to think it is drowning.  This will cause it to divert oxygen from unimportant parts of the body  like that muscle causing hiccups  to more important parts like the heart  the brain  the organs  etc.So...take a glass of water  slowly exhale.  Pinch your nose.  Take about 5 or 6 sips of water (or more until you can't take it any longer) from the glass...making sure you are taking in WATER ONLY. Do NOT sip any air along with the water.  Stop.Hold your breath for a few seconds  and inhale slowly. The hiccups should disappear. If not repeat.I have found this works 90% of the time.  It only fails to work if there really is something stuck in your throat that really needs to be expelled by hiccups or coughing  or drinking lots of water.
777,What is the best (comprehensive  upto date  quality of review) web resource for FREE online ratings of Wine.?,Free is tough  but if it's what you want  then look no further than www.wineaccess.com. It's actually an aggregator of wine retailers (and more  but I won't get into it)--the catch is that you can only check out Steven Tanzer's reviews if one of their wine retailers has the wine in stock. Not sure how broad ST's reviews go  but he seems to cover a lot of US and French wines. They have supplemental reviews by other another rater called CGCW.
778,Why do Canadians Celebrate Thanks giving?,"Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving on the 2nd Monday of October.""The farmers in Europe held celebrations at harvest time. They filled a curved goat's horn with fruit and grain to give thanks for their good fortune and the abundance of food. They brought this tradition when they came to Canada.During the American Revolution  Americans who remained loyal to England moved to Canada where they brought the customs and practices of the American Thanksgiving to Canada.""More information about the history of Canadian Thanksgiving:http://www.geocities.com/ouravonlea/canadian-thanksgiving.html"

781,"What ever happened to ""New Coke""?","After New Coke was introduced in 1985  there was a huge outcry among Coke drinkers that forced the company to reintroduce the original formula (rebranded ""Classic"" Coke) after just two months.  New Coke was eventually renamed ""Coke II"" (not to be confused with the more recent ""C2"") and had a tiny market share for a few years.  It apparently is no longer sold in the U.S.  although it is still listed as one of the company's brands.The Snopes article below has a very detailed history of the New Coke fiasco (also debunking the myth that the whole thing was done on purpose)."

The reason is if the baby doesn't finish the whole bottle  you'll lose the breast milk.  You can give priority to the breast milk and only use formula when needed.  Remember  breastmilk is always better than baby formula.

785,what is the history of Crater Lake?,Crater Lake is found in Southwest Oregon and the second deepest lake in North America (1 932 ft/589 m) and it was previously called Deep Blue Lake in 1853 because of its deep blue color.  It was renamed Crater Lake in 1869.  Crater Lake was formed by volcanic activity of Mt. Mazama.Crater Lake is the seventh deepest lake in the world.

786,is it a good idea to lease a car? dare to share experience?,It is a fine idea to lease a car if:-Tend to switch cars every couple years-Drive a fairly consistent number of miles every year (which is under the limit)-You want to drive a car which is in demand and has a high resale value.-You have no interest in modifying your carEssentially  with a lease you are financing the depreciation of the car over the time you are driving it.  For instance  for a 40K BMW  it may depreciate to around $28K after two years  so you finance the $12K difference.  Since lease prices are tied to depreciation and not base price of a vehicle  you can afford a more expensive car than you would ordinarily be able to finance.  Typically the best deals are through the finance arms of the manufacturers of the cars.  Keep these facts in mind and you'll be fine.

789,Which is better in terms of reliability and value for money  a C240 Sedan or C230 Coupe?,"The C230 Coupe is a better value for money.  The Coupe was launched in europe at a HIGHER price point than the sedan  but because hatchbacks do not sell well in europe  MB USA decided to price it lower in the US.  If you don't need rear seats the coupe offers more cargo versatility as well as the skyview roof  which gives you many of the advantages of a convertible with the security of a fixed roof.  The C230 Coupe also has every safety feature available on the C240 sedan.The C240 has a 168 HP V6 engine which is fairly weak  particularly with the sedan.  There are two C230 coupes.  They both have around 190 hp  but the newer models have a 1.8L aluminum engine  whereas the older models have a 2.3L iron engine.  Both are reliable  but the 1.8 is the newer model. The way you can tell is by looking at the trim behind the front wheel. The 2.3 has no badge there but the 1.8 says ""1.8"" on the rubstrip.  The 1.8L is supposed to handle and drive better and was released in 2003 I believe."
790,Is it normal to be with a guy you're dating for a month every single day?,Yes of course  the early phase of a relationship is often the most intense.  I would take it as a good sign  unless you're feeling smothered.  Then it might be wise to let him know.
791,"Why is the Mini commonly called a ""Mini Cooper?"" Who is Cooper?","John Cooper was Alec Issigonis' friend and also a race car driver.  They collaborated on making a sportier Mini which was then called the Mini Cooper.  Interestingly the Mini Cooper is the base model here in the US (which is why all minis here are Coopers) but in europe there is a lower priced model just named the Mini One.  As a result the phrase ""Mini Cooper"" is not interchangable with ""Mini"" in europe."

794,Anyone have a recommendation for a good day spa that offers full body massage in Cincinatti?,If your on a budget and just want a full body massage then call the Cincinnati School for Medical Massage.  You can get an hour massage for $34. or if you buy gift certificates you can get 4 for $100.  Each time it's an hour long.  Most of the students are very good... occasionally you might get one that does too much pinching but that's everywhere.
795,What is Visual Basic?,Visual Basic is a programming language and software development environment created by Microsoft in the 1990s primarily to make it easy for developers to create client applications on Windows. It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen  and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click).The language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript  and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Around the time of Windows 98's release  it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop.In 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. At that time Visual Basic was thoroughly revised and renamed to Visual Basic .NET. This version of the language added some capabilities  but dropped others  and was incompatible with previous versions of the language  leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. Still  a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications  Web apps  script  and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel.
796,What's your definition of Web 2.0?,The best article I've read on the subject is in the link below.  In summary  the article cites the following 7 factors common to Web 2.0:* Services  not packaged software  with cost-effective scalability* Control over unique  hard-to-recreate data sources that get richer as more people use them* Trusting users as co-developers* Harnessing collective intelligence* Leveraging the long tail through customer self-service* Software above the level of a single device* Lightweight user interfaces  development models  AND business models
797,Should the A's trade Zito this off-season?,"IMHO  the A's will be traded Zito this off-season or in the middle of next season.  The ""Money-ball"" philosophy has been working for them and they will continue.  Trading Zito will also get them some good young players too."
798,How can I get commercial prints of my digital photographs to look more like they look on screen?,Tiger's suggestion is probably the best way to go about this.  Make sure you choose a picture with a good range of colors  or you may end up adjusting for one part of the sprectrum while completely destroying another.On another note  I've noticed Costco prints are generally always too dark.  I would recommend Walmart's service.

800,What is Kwanzaa?,"Like many holidays around the winter solstice period  the origins lay in pre-Christian agrarian traditions  where the waning sunlight was noted with celebrations of the deceased and the last/first harvest. Some examples are the Germanic Pagan festival of Yule and the Meso-American celebration of el Dia de las Muertas.Kwanzaa too  is a celebration originating from the first harvest festivals of African peoples.  According the official Kwanzaa site  ""The first-fruits celebrations are recorded in African history as far back as ancient Egypt and Nubia and appear in ancient and modern times in other classical African civilizations such as Ashantiland and Yorubaland"".Kwanzaa was established in 1966 in the midst of the Black Freedom Movement to affirm the culture and identity of African American peoples and to unify them in a celebration of family  community  and a unique cultural heritage that had been supressed for many centuries under slavery.The seven symbols of Kwanzaa are spelled out in Swahili  an East African language. They are the crops  the mat  the candleholder  the corn  the seven candles  the unity cup  and the gifts. These symbols represent  respectively: the rewards of productive labor  tradition  African roots  children/the future  the Seven Principles  unity  and the love of parents/committment of children."
801,Why do we drive on the parkway...?,Parkway doesn't refer to parking a car  it refers to the greenery or parkland landscape next to the road.The driveway isn't necessarily meant for parking a car  though many people do. It is the path you drive up to get to the house.
802,What is a blog?,"There are several types of blogs  or Web logs. They have outgrown their old description of ""an online diary"" and have become a new way for citizen publishers to share opinions and information.There are commercial blogs  like Captain Morgan's Rum's ""Captain's Blog"" which mainly serves to market a product.There are political blogs  which gained prominence in the last election for scooping traditional news sources on some stories.There are technology blogs  which alert developers and consumers to emerging trends and products.You can find a blog on any subject under the sun  from new parents gushing over their offspring to serious commentary about world events.To discover new and interesting blog content  I recommend Technorati and Feedster."
803,Should high schools offer classes on SAT for all?,I'd say yes  all high schools should offer SAT test prep. The main two reasons:1) Workers 18 and over with a bachelor’s degree earn an average of $51 206 a year  while those with a high school diploma earn $27 915. (U.S. Census Bureau).Basically  college grads earn twice as much money as high school grads. This increased income provides more security  support to raise a family  and the means for furthering ones education.2) College grads have access to better jobs as many jobs require a college degree.
804,which is the more powerful crime family - the corleone's or the soprano's?,The Corleones are more powerful  hands down.and for one reason  alone: The Sopranos don't have the muscle to take out the heads of all five crime families in one swoop and live to tell about it  including the big man in Vegas and take over his operation. The Corleons are a much bigger organization with a wider network.Head to head war Corleones (GF1) vs. Sopranos (S1):Vito (or Michael) Corleone vs. Tony SopranoSonny vs. ChristopherClemenza vs. SilvioTessio vs. PaulieFredo vs. Big PussyBarzini vs. Juniorand Kay vs. Carmela :-)

806,What is avian flu and why is everyone so worried about it?,Avian flu is a serious virus that can be dangerous to the elderly  the young  and anyone with compromised immune systems.  While it is mostly still contained to birds  it is spreading rapidly and there have been reports of it spreading to humans.Excerpts from the CDC:Bird flu is an infection caused by avian (bird) influenza (flu) viruses. These flu viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines  but usually do not get sick from them. However  bird flu is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds  including chickens  ducks  and turkeys  very sick and kill them.Bird flu viruses do not usually infect humans  but several cases of human infection with bird flu viruses have occurred since 1997.The current outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N1) among poultry in Asia and Europe (see below) is an example of a bird flu outbreak that has caused human infections and deaths. In such situations  people should avoid contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces  and should be careful when handling and cooking poultry. For more information about avian influenza and food safety issues  visit the the World Health Organization websiteSymptoms of bird flu in humans have ranged from typical flu-like symptoms (fever  cough  sore throat and muscle aches) to eye infections  pneumonia  severe respiratory diseases (such as acute respiratory distress)  and other severe and life-threatening complications. The symptoms of bird flu may depend on which virus caused the infection.
807,What's the best way to protect a small outdoor tropical tree from frost?,"How much you need to protect the tree depends on how delicate the tree is and how bad your frosts get.  Some ""tropical"" trees are actually just fine down to occasional 20 degree temperatures.  Other trees will just up and die at anything below freezing.Things you can do to protect a plant:+ Water it.  A well-watered plant can better protect itself from frost.+ Cover it.  Even a light cover can prevent a lot of damage.  Just toss an old sheet over the tree.+ Buy ""cloud cover.""  its a spray you can get from garden stores that will protect the leaves from damage.  You'll have to reapply it after a rain.Obviously you can't do this all year so if you live in an area that freezes all winter you may just lose the plant.  If you only get occasional frosts you'll have to pay attention to the weather.  In general dry  still nights are worse than wet or windy nights.  I find that if the teperature has dropped below 40 degrees and there's no wind by 9 or 10PM I'd better go out and cover my lemon trees.  If its just cold and rainy I don't worry so much.Good luck!"
808,What cell phone would you recommend for Cingular?,"Nokia 6682. It's not available from all/many Cingular stores as of last week  but they claim to be getting more in soon (apparently there was a firmware problem with some people's SIM cards).This phone has regularly been reviewed as one of the ""best of breed"" for smartphones that aren't hardcore PIMs (a la Treo  Blackberry). It's a phone first and foremost  but has Symbian OS  and there are a ton of apps you can add to it. Plus  great bluetooth compatibility and a reasonable size (not quite as small as the V551 you have  but much nicer screen IMO... and a better camera.)Probably the best phone (PHONE!) Cingular has at the moment. If you can't find one at the Cingular store  you can order it from Nokia's site directly and apparently  keep your existing plan (I think... there's a phone number to validate that as you get through the checkout process.) Or just buy one anywhere  as long as it's unlocked  your Cingular SIM will work as long as it's not one of the ""3G"" cards."
809,Why are the Dutch so tall?,"As a dutchman  and someone who's 6'4"" I should be able to answer this one.Specifically though there actually has been a fair amount of research around this  the average height of the dutch are indeed abover average and I've heard claims of it being ""the tallest nation in the world"".The average dutchman is about 6'1"" (4"" taller than the avg american)Research shows it to be a combo of genetics  disease prevention  diet (dairy  etc.)   average wealth&wellbeing  as well as the psychosocial wellbeing.. all affecting height.So to summarize: drink your milk  get your shots  be happy and grow grow grow..oh and a bit of genetics.From a research report:Genetic factors are evident in marked regional differences between the north and the south of the Netherlands. In the north  boys are on average 50 mm taller and girls 20 mm taller. The populations are relatively stable  and Frisians are genetically more Scandinavian  whereas Limburgers have southern European roots. However  although boys in Turkish and Moroccan immigrant groups are about 95 mm shorter than ethnic Dutch  they are taller than in their countries of origin. Researchers point to the increase over the past 30 years in the amount of protein in the diets of the Dutch  the world's highest consumers of dairy products.Miranda Fredriks  one of the researchers in the recent study  emphasised other health and hygiene factors as well as diet--for example  the Netherlands has a 95% vaccination rate among children.Lastly it's the healthcare system and wealth  every dutch person has access to the healthcare system and overall the dutch are fairly well off to being with. It's been shown that wealth has a direct impact on height.."

812,Should the Sharks trade Evgeni Nabokov?,In short  no.If they trade him now they will see minimal returns on a trade. They are dealing from a weak position. Should Nolan Schaefer get a shot? Yes.Nabokov should be given a chance to rest  start Nolan for a couple of games and then get him back in there. I believe he will be able to snap out of this funk  but trading him now would be the absolute worst time for them to trade him in terms of what they could get in return.
813,What are the best places to see in San Francisco?,"Where to begin! San Francisco is a great place to visit  and it holds new surprises every time you return.If you've never been before  you may enjoy staying someplace central like Union Square. From there you can BART to the Mission district and as far south as SF Airport  or to the Embarcadero and all the way to the East Bay.  Your other public transportation options are the cable car (which picks up right at Powell and Market) and the bus. There are several bus lines that can take you all throughout the city from here.Union Square also houses many upscale shops and some very nice restaurants. I recommend lunch at the Rotunda in Nieman Marcus  which affords a view of all of Union Square.You can take the cable car to Fisherman's Wharf from here. Although it is very ""touristy""  it also gives you a glimpse of what the shipping and canning industry used to be like here. You can also check out the very entertaining Amusing America at Pier 45. You have lots of great seafood dining options in this area.The Embarcadero is very much improved in these past few years. It's now a great promenade and hosts a Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building a couple of times a week. Nearby Embarcadero Center is another shopping destination. If you're here in the spring/summer  definitely try to catch a Giants game at SBC Park  which is a world class ball park!If you come in summer  you'll likely run into one of the many street fairs that happen in neighborhoods throughout the city. Lots of good food  interesting crafts  live music and a real taste of San Francisco.There are a lot of terrific museums here. Downtown you'll find the SF MoMA  which is a decent collection in a gorgeous building. Right across the street is Yerba Buena Gardens and the Metreon  where you can catch a movie  play a game of billiards or even go ""virtual bowling"".  The DeYoung just reopened in a brand new building. That will put you right in the heart of Golden Gate Park  which has bike paths  gardens  a conservatory of flowers  the Japanese tea garden  man-made lakes  and even a bison paddock.You'll get a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge from the Marina Green and Crissy field  both of which are great for walking  exercising  and just plain people watching!I could go on and on! San Francisco has something to offer everyone  and is worth more than one trip!"
814,Can animals really predict earthquakes?,There was a PBS program 'Nature'  just aired a couple of weeks ago  about whether animals can predict nature disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. Whether animals can predict earthquakes is not conclusive. But there's a scientist in Berkeley (forgot his name) claimed he had predicted earthquakes accurately in the last few decades. What he used was simply newspaper ads on missing pets. He said normally you'd see about 10-15 missing pets ads  but before earthquakes  the missing pets ads would increase. His theory is contraversial  but it's worth a try. You may want to test that theory.The program also mentioned about the terrible tsunami in Asia over a year ago. It mentioned none of the animals got harmed since they 'knew' the waves were coming and escaped from the disaster.One theory is that animals can hear low frequency sound from beneath the earth  like grinding sound of moving rocks.Anyway  you'll find some interesting programs on PBS stations.
815,Sopranos or The Wire: If you had to choose one?,I've got to stick by Tony and his crew. The Sopranos  in my opinion  still rules the roost. I was especially impressed with this last season and the manner in which Tony's psychological state was once again used in dream sequencing...excellent stuff.The Wire has a lot of tension and fast paced development  which is good  but The Sopranos seems to be more intent on slow burning character development  which has paid off in big ways. Just my two cents...
816,"Who wrote the screen play for ""The Big Lebowski""?","The Coen brothers: Ethan and Joel. Joel also directed the movie. And together  they've written other off-beat films like ""Fargo""  ""O Brother  Where Art Thou?"" and more."
817,Things to do in Seattle?,If you have just a weekend  you can go to the Space Needle + Experience Music Project (they are adjacent) and monorail over to downtown where you can walk to Pike's Place Market.Now... if you are interested in night life  you can hit Capitol club  Baltic room  and Linda's all within walking distance from each other on pine street in Capitol Hill.  Capitol Hill is just up the Hill to the East from downtown.If you go there during the day  there are also a bunch on funky shops on Broadway  Pike and Pine Streets.

There is an outdoor area with heaters that's very spacious and isn't just a patio onto the road but actually a part of the bar itself (in fact about the same size as the interior). There's even a pool table outside. Obviously  you can smoke cigars or cigarettes in this area.
822,How can i transfer the shows on my dvr to a dvd?,A good resource for this type of thing is the Extraction  Insertion  and Streaming Support forum on DealDatabase.

824,Are you fundamentally the same person as you were 10 years ago?,I have barely changed at all.  Maybe more confident and articulate but in terms of hobbies and interests I am pretty much into all the same things that I was into when I was 8 (and then some).  It's good to be earning an adult income while having child hobbies.

827,Does Lexus deliver new vehicles after they are purchased to a customer’s home?,Depends on the dealer  though most will if you ask.
828,Is it important to send a thank you note after an interview?,It is a nice touch  even in a casual workplace  to get the business cards of people you interview with  and send them a quick email thank you note. Although it will not sway the decision of that particular job  if there's another job that the person knows about  they will remember you and have your email in their inbox to contact you about it.  Just be brief  and don't make it sound like a form letter.

832,What further training or additional courses should would-be teachers be required to take?,Being an Master Educator myself  I would say that courses should be required that not only provide teachers-in-training a mastery of their content area  but also a better understanding of pedagogy  classroom management  and how to integrate technology into their classroom. I would also agree with the previous poster about ethics training.The content area knowledge would make them more knowledgable and therefore more capable of effectively communicating the important aspects of what they are teaching preferably in ways other than the standard lecture. Similarly  I am seeing that many new teachers are coming out with a less than ideal level of knowledge with regard to the pedagogical implications of their teaching techniques. By spending more time on how to effectively differentiate instruction and deliver exciting lessons  many new teachers would be ahead of the game.Additionally  classroom management is an important skill that is normally only taught (experientially) during field experiences. Knowing that this is generally an area of concern for new teachers more emphasis should be placed on it.Finally  integrating technology would help teachers to move away from standard textbooks  which while adequate  don't provide students the depth of knowledge they need to really understand the materials they are learning.The sum-total of all of these parts is a more well rounded teacher who is better prepared to engage students and enjoy a very rewarding career as a teacher.
833,will golden state warriors make it to the playoffs this year ?,No they won't. There are too many better teams in front of them in the Western Conference. Likely locks for the West include San Antonio  Houston  Dallas  Phoenix  Denver  Seattle. Which leaves the Warriors battling for the last 2 spots against LAL  Memphis and Sacramento - all of which are better teams.

835,I have a desktop with a 82845 GL Intel integrated video card 64MB w/ no AGP slot.  Should I upgrade via PCI?,Most onboard video for PC desktop motherboards are far short of performance for even a PCI-only card.  For the Intel 845 chipset  having a dedicated PCI video card can definitely improve your performance  especially for 3D games.
836,How can I find the dhcp server on Linux ?,"There are a number of different DHCP clients that run on Linux.  Use the command ""ps ax"" to try to determine what processes are running that might have something to do with your ethernet interface.DHCPCD is a popular one.  Look to /etc/dhcpc for any files that might be there.PUMP is also a frequent program in use by some versions of RedHat Linux.  Run ""pump -i eth0 --status"" assuming your ethernet interface is eth0DHCLIENT -- run ""locate dhclient.leases"" and look into that file if you see that process running."

839,What is the difference between permutations and combinations?,PermutationSuppose we want to find the number of ways to arrange the three letters in the word CAT in different two-letter groups where CA is different from AC and there are no repeated letters.Because order matters  we're finding the number of permutations of size 2 that can be taken from a set of size 3. This is often written 3_P_2. We can list them as:CA   CT   AC   AT   TC   TACombinationWhen we want to find the number of combinations of size 2 without repeated letters that can be made from the three letters in the word CAT  order doesn't matter; AT is the same as TA. We can write out the three combinations of size two that can be taken from this set of size three:CA   CT   AT

842,"What does ""buck naked"" mean?","Dating from the 1920's the expression buck naked commonly means completely or totally naked or without a ""stitch"" (as opposed to partially naked). Synonyms include ""bare naked""  ""buck-arse naked""  and ""butt naked"" (also spelled  facetiously  ""butt nekkid""). In the South  ""buck naked"" or ""butt naked"" means not in your house  out looking for trouble on Saturday night and wearing no clothes."
843,Who is the best soccer player in the world? Accordingly to FIFA and accordingly to general audience?,"the last (2004) FIFA best player of the world is Ronaldinho (playing at barcelona  don't confuse with Ronaldo  playing at Real Madrid). Read the official FIFA interview with him at http://www.fifa.com/en/mens/awards/gala.htmlAlso  TODAY (november 28  2005)  Ronaldinho is going to receive the ""Ballon D'Or"" (golden ball)  prize created by the french magazine French Football --http://www.francefootball.fr/ -- in 1956 to distinguish the best player of the european leagues. The complete list of winners of this prize is at: http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/ballon_or/index_bo.htmlNow  the general audience... this is tough  since there are many players that could be the best at any time (henry  lampard  ronaldo  ronaldinho  zidane -getting older  though-  kaká  eto'o  ...). But truth is that  at this moment of the season  Ronaldinho is one step above the rest  and playing in the current best team (barcelona) helps him a lot."
844,What can I do besides divorce if I don't love my spouse anymore?,Your spouse deserves a chance to move on and find someone who does love him/her  so you should have a frank talk. On the other hand  some couples are best friends and care deeply about each other  but just are not in love anymore. In both cases  talking it over and deciding together what your future will be is best.
845,How many answers does a typical Q&A question get?,Well... being that people get 'points' for answering questions  I'm sure there will be a lot of 'filler' questions going into this one  so I'd guess you'll get 50 in here  but about 4 or 5 on average.
846,Is there a place to buy a pre-configured MythTV system?,Sadly  no.  I believe this is because providing the expected support for a MythTV preconfigured box would be difficult.  I have a Windows Media Center 2005 PC and find that it works very well  I currently record terrestrial HD and comcast cable (via a set top box) simultaneously with no issues.  Also works great with DiVX movies and tv shows.  Those are certainly available as preconfigured boxes (in fact  only available preconfigured).
847,Will there ever be another figure in rock that comes even close to Jimi Hendrix?,In terms of guitar-playing chops  what about Eddie Van Halen  Eric Clapton  Carlos Santana? In terms of showmanship  what about Iggy Pop  Mick Jagger  Bono?  In terms of cool guy who died way too young  what about Kurt Cobain?
848,In the quest for dazzling teeth  how harmful are teeth whitening strips?,Depends on your teeth.  I used Crest Whitestrips for a time  and they worked really well (I definitely noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth).  However  they irritated my gums to the point where my dentist told me to stop using them and they made my teeth super sensitive to cold and hot (i.e. eating ice cream or drinking tea was painful).  I've never done the laser whitening/Brite Smile  but I've seen those treatments work wonders for folks who have (they are not cheap though).  I would advise trying the strips (making sure to abide by the time guidelines) - you will like the effects of them (they do really work) and if they don't bother your teeth/gums  you should be able to continue use.
849,when should i change the tires of my car?,The link that was posted above says 2/32 of an inch of tread is when to change. This is absolutely correct and is the legal limit in some states.The easiest way to check is to do the Lincoln test with a penny. Take a penny and insert Lincoln's head into you tire tread where the tread is most worn. If you can see above Lincoln's head then you need a new tire. If his head is obscured by the tread then you are still ok.
850,Do schools need better teachers or more funding? Why?,Both  and neither.  Schools need better support for their current teachers to help them become better.  There's an over 50% turnover rate of new teachers in the first year.  A little high  don't you think?  A lot of it is about administrative and group support  new teachers a lot of times are thrown to the wolves.  Better support a lot of times doesn't exist because the funding isn't there for teacher development  so it's a catch-22.
851,Where did the name Mercedes Benz come from?,"Automobile manufacturers Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschat and Benz were competitors in Germany in the early 1900's. In 1926  the two companies merged.""A symbol was chosen for the combined products of DMG and Benz. The new insignia was a three-pointed star wreathed with laurel. The word ""Mercedes"" was at the top and the word ""Benz"" was at the bottom."""
852,"Can someone *simply* explain what a stock ""short"" is?",Shorting a stock (or selling short) ideally works like this:When you think a stock is going to go down...1. You borrow shares of stock you don't own  typically from your broker.2. You sell those shares at today's price.3. You wait for the stock to go down.4. You buy the same number of shares back at a lower price.5. You return the borrowed shares.6. You pocket the difference between the buying and selling price.Steps 1&5 are actually done automatically when you issue a short sale order with a broker.The advantage of shorting is that you can make money when stocks are going down.  (With a normal stock purchases  you only make money if the stock goes up.)The disadvantage is that in theory  you could lose an unlimited amount of money.  For example  if the stock goes up to five times its original value  you've just lost four times your investment.  (With a regular stock purchase  the most you can lose is the amount you originally invested.)
853,Is there an AIM/Yahoo/Jabber/chat client that is multi-platform that also provides encryption options?,The easiest way to have an encrypted conversation between any platform is probably to use a jabber server that supports SSL.  jabber.org supports SSL  and clients are freely available for every platform.  Adium for Mac is a good client  Gaim for Linux  and Gaim or Trillian for Windows should cover most of your needs using that combination.
854,Is there a cure for malaria?,There are several means of successfully treating malaria if contracted  yet malaria is still one of the leading causes of preventable death in the developing world.  The reason is that most of these people are too poor to afford even basic preventative measures like bednets (which keeps malarial misquitoes from biting children in their sleep).Bednets are important step to reducing the impact of malaria  because it is much more expensive to treat malaria once it is contracted than it is to prevent it via bednets  removing standing water  etc.There are some efforts to find cheaper alternative treatments as well  including one promising one that comes from Chinese herbal medicine.http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/11/26/health.malaria/I've also attached a CDC (center for disease control) article that describes some of the anti-malarial drugs currently being used.
855,Who the heck is the Dalai Lama?,"The Dalai Lama is a spiritual and secular ruler of some Buddhists in Tibet (and around the ruler).  There are other ""lamas"" -- leaders of other followers who belong to other sects of Tibetan Buhhism.Tenzin Gyatso (Tibetan: བསྟན་འཛིན་རྒྱ་མཚོ་ Wylie: Bstan 'dzin Rgya mtsho) (b. July 6  1935) is the fourteenth and current Dalai Lama. The fifth of nine children of a farming family in the Tibetan province of Amdo  he was proclaimed the tulku (reincarnation) of the thirteenth Dalai Lama at the age of three. On November 17  1950  at the age of fifteen  he was enthroned as Tibet's Head of State and most important political ruler  while Tibet faced occupation by the forces of the People's Republic of China.After the collapse of the Tibetan resistance movement in 1959  Tenzin Gyatso fled to India  where he was active in establishing the government of Tibet in exile and preserving Tibetan culture and education among the thousands of refugees who accompanied him.A charismatic figure and noted public speaker  Tenzin Gyatso is the first Dalai Lama to travel to the West  where he has helped to spread Buddhism and to publicise the cause of Free Tibet. In 1989  he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.In Tibetan Buddhism  the successive Dalai Lamas (taa-la'i bla-ma) form a tulku lineage of Gelugpa leaders which trace back to 1391. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be the present incarnation of Avalokitesvara (""Chenrezig"" [spyan ras gzigs] in Tibetan)  the bodhisattva of compassion. Between the 17th century and 1959  the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government  controlling a large portion of the country from the capital Lhasa. The Dalai Lamas never had authority over every region of Tibet nor over the other sects of Tibetan Buddhism. The current Dalai Lama (the 14th) is a respected Tibetan Buddhist religious leader and figurehead of the International Tibet Independence Movement; in English  he is often granted the style ""His Holiness"" (or HH) before his title."

858,Any learning center that offers Personalized tutoring programs in Portland?,The answer above is a great idea.  Of course  this will only work if you don't mind non-person to person tutoring.I would contact your local high schools and see if there are any tutors that will tutor your kid.  It might help both the high school student (elective credit) and your kid (because young kids look up to high school students).Newspapers are always advertising people looking for work such as nannies  care-takers  and yes...even tutors.I would try the high schools first.Here are a list of tutorint centers in the Portland area:http://www.anysubject.com/portland-tutors.asphttp://portland.craigslist.com/lss/http://www.mindsinmotiontutoring.com/

860,What is AMG and what does it stand for?,Aufrecht Melcher Grossaspach  I answered your other question  but essentially it's Mercedes' sport designation.  Similar to M cars for BMW or S cars for Audi.
861,What does Sarbaines Oxley compliant mean?,The Sarbanes-Oxley act was sponsored by Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Michael Oxley  and is a response to the auditing scandals surrounding Enron  WorldCom  and others.  Essentially it aims to protect investors by requiring public companies to adhere to certain standards around auditor independence  information integrity  and greater financial disclosure.From an IT perspective S-Ox compliance revolves around preserving information and ensuring that the systems that maintain financial records are capturing all the correct data.  Of course  S-Ox compliance can be rather complex and counterintuitive  so there are plenty of consultants who earn a living by making companies S-Ox compliant  as it is a requirement for all public companies.
862,how old would Jesus be today?,I assume you are asking about Jesus as the man Christians believe to be the son of Christ and not Jesus as the all-powerful God (who has no age).To answer your second question first  to find out how old someone is  you count years from their birth  not death. It is estimated that Jesus was born between 7 and 4 BCE  which would make him between 2 009 and 2 012 years old this year (2005).To calculate: take 2005 CE (the year we are in now) and add 4-7  the BCE years (which are years before the year 0).I hope this helps! :)
863,Does the Fix-A-Flat product really work? Does it do any damage?,It essentially destroys the inside of your tire in order to plug the hole  by chemically bonding with the rubber in the tire..  If you use Fix-A-Flat  basically you should count on buying a new tire instead of patching the hole.  Also  since many forms of debris remain in the tire  fix-a-flat can trick you into thinking your tire is ok while there is a nail or something doing even more damage.      Changing a tire is extremely simple to do and if you practice it once you'll be surprised at how easy it is.
864,What reality show had appearances by has-been actors such as V Ice  T Faye and J Cansenco?,"It's the reality show ""The Surreal Life."""
865,What should I do if my ex wants a casual relationship but I want more?,Be absolutely honest with your ex. If s/he isn't willing to give you the commitment you want  you're just setting yourself up for a heartache.On the other hand  articulating your feelings for your ex may make him/her want you back on your terms!  You'll never know until you own up to your feelings and let them out.
866,How do I compress a file?,"Run the free program ""gzip""  which you can download from http://www.gzip.org/Even though you didn't specify which machine you're on  you can almost certainly use gzip  which will work on all the important OS's."

869,Are expensive urethane golf balls e.g. Titleist Pro V1 worth it for the normal club golfer?,I find that it does. The Pro V1 for me is the best ball out there in terms of providing durability  distance and control. I've also used Nike and Top Flight and always come back to the Pro V1. But  the real answer is how the ball reacts to your swing and game. I recommend playing a few rounds with different brands.
870,Do you have a recommendation for a clean  quiet and decent apartment complex in Vegas?,It depends on where you want to move.  I lived in Crystal Creek at Warm Springs  Henderson  NV 89014  Very affordable and the place is pretty decent.
871,Where should I get my dollars exchanged to Real?,Don't. Use a credit card when possible for the best rate  plus it's much safer than carrying around cash in Brazil.If you need cash for incidentals (taxi  etc.)  withdraw from an ATM - small service fee but good rates.
872,What is the meaning of life?,"Well  from wich perspective do you look at it? In my opinion  physical reality incarnations are done for the purpouse of spiritual growth...""body is a car  soul is a driver  YOU"". Aside from that  I believe all is devine  in other words  all is god  source  as some say it. I also believe that each seek's to reunite with source... :) Take Care  Love and Light"
873,What is the difference between dating and in a relationship?,"The difference is the level of commitment. ""Dating"" connotes a casual thing  not necessarily exclusive. When a person says ""I'm dating Bill"" instead of ""Bill is my boyfriend""  you can probably guess the relationship is relatively new and no commitment has been made.When you've decided you're in a relationship  you'll probably start referring to one another as boyfriend/girlfriend. You'll introduce each other to your close friends and family. You'll likely spend a LOT of time together  and may take it for granted that you'll see each other certain nights and weekends. Depending on your lifestyle  you may agree to make your relationship exclusive and stop seeing other people.If you're uncomfortable discussing taking things to ""the next level"" you're probably just dating  and not quite ready for a relationship."
874,Where can I find a list of important events from a year in history?,The link below would take you to a list of important events.
875,Why did Mark David Chapman kill John Lennon?,"According to an AP article: Though previously a great fan of the Beatles  Chapman began attaching Caulfield's favorite slander ""phony"" to Lennon. He made that assessment after seeing photos of Lennon atop his exclusive Manhattan apartment building  the Dakota.""At some point  after looking at those pictures  I became enraged at him and something in me just broke "" Chapman would explain later. ""I remember saying in my mind  `What if I killed him?'""""I felt that perhaps my identity would be found in the killing of John Lennon."""
876,Where is the best buffet in Vegas?,elegance wise - probably the wynn buffett.best deal - rio
877,"Why in the House of Commons does the P.M. often say ""I refer the hon. gentleman to the answer I gave earlier""?","Another reason is that the P.M.'s responses are scripted in advance  where at all possible.  Questions from the House--especially from the opposition--are designed to get him off his game and distract him from the prepared text  in the hope of making him look bad.  (A similar game is played by many television correspondents: ""If the interviewee gives a pat answer  ask the question ten more times.  Play only the most emotive response."")  By referring the questioner back to the earlier  prepared answer  the P.M. short-circuits this tactic.  Stilted  but effective."
878,How many pairs of shoes were found when Imelda Marcos left the presidential palace in 1986?,Imelda Marcos had a very large collection of shoes and lingerie. She reportedly owned 3 000 pairs of shoes (size 8 1⁄2)  which were found by the opposition forces after the Marcos regime was overthrown in 1986.
879,How to get rid of stretch marks after pregnancy?,One word: Strivectin. And  its been reappropriated by the pretty people as a fantastic facial wrinkle cream. Everyone I know swears by it. Banish the stretch marks and forego the Preparation-H. All at the same time. :-)
880,What are the best high capacity MP3 players that support Y! Music Unlimited?,Microsoft has a PlaysForSure website that allows you to search for subscription compatible players.  The PlaysForSure logo can be very confusing since many PlaysForSure devices don't play subscription tracks like those offered by Yahoo  Napster  and Rhapsody.You can select the Audio Subscription option as well as the 20GB+ option to get a list of players:http://www.playsforsure.com/AdvancedSearch.aspxOnce you've identified some players of interest I would check out:http://dontbuyjunk.com/searchpage.php/category=1 http://reviews.cnet.com/4566-6490_7-0.html?tag=ont.hdmp3&filter=500891_5052322_They should help you find the player that's right for you.I've used the Creative Zen Micro with YME and it has worked pretty well.  Its definitely not as good as the iPod line  but the fact that it supports subscription music makes it much more valuable to me.

882,Why is SAT important?,Most colleges and universities use your SAT score as a factor in determining admissions. While it may be possible to get a waiver in some cases  your chances at consideration are much greater if you take the SAT.Another reason to take the SAT is for financial aid consideration. Grants and scholarships  especially those run by the school or private organizations  often take SAT scores along with grade point average into account.

887,Why do non-Vegetarians get so defensive at the mere mention that one is a Vegetarian?,"Maybe because they feel put-upon by your 'special request'. If you tell a party host you're a Vegetarian  he may feel that you expect him to provide extra food that would be suitable for you. If you tell a date you're a Vegetarian  he may feel that his choice of date restaurants is limited by your lifestyle.Or are you in their face about your Vegetarianism?  If you're an activist  they may feel that you are judging their choice to eat meat.You'll win people over to your way of living if you aren't demanding and are flexible with your choices.If you're invited to a dinner party  offer to bring a Vegetarian dish to share with the others.  If you're invited out to dinner  be armed with restaurant choices that can accomodate you. ""Ethnic"" restaurants are usually a safe bet.Don't push your beliefs on others  but definitely share them if asked. Vegetarianism is a very personal choice  so know that your personal story will be more compelling than political statements."
888,what is the most popular programming laguage in use today?,"This is a tough one  and no doubt a potential debate point in most cases.   I would really doubt that C# has any real future.Java  on the other hand  is written in C.  Most modern development platforms have a foundation in C.If this question is to choose a language path for school  I think either Java or C is fine.  Though I would say that you will become a better programmer if you have a more detailed understanding of what is ""under the hood"".  In that case C (and a bit of assembly isn't bad to at least take a look at).  The more higher-level you go  the less you can ultimately do."
889,What are the odds of life on another planet?,Answers to this question can vary greatly  but a good framework to think about it is the Drake Equation.  Developed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan  it runs through some of the key factors that will effect the viability of life on other planets.  As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology  we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation  but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species  we have very little data to go on.So when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt.If you are simply talking about life  I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high.  The discovery of many extrasolar planets including some that are closer to Earth size means that there are specific places we can point to where life may have formed or be forming.  Even in stranger systems that feature planets several times Jupiter's mass  it is possible that a terrestrial satellite of such a large planet could harbor the right conditions for life.It's a fun thing to work through the Drake equation yourself.  Since the last few terms are more subjective (at least until we get more data)  it's fun to play with it and see where you stand.The best guess that scientists have put forward right now is:N = 10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 × 1×10-7 × 0.01 × 67 = 2.211×10-7 = 0.0000002211where N is the number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that might come to communicate with us in a year.To get the number of planets that reach a point of harboring life (not intelligent) in a year  we just take the first 4 terms:10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 = 3.3So about 3.3 new planets reach the point where life forms per year.
890,Does anyone know a vacation rental service in Washington DC that offers great rates?,I don't know of any Washington specific sites  but you can find a good list of Vacation Rentals sites  together with comparative pricing  reviews and owner comments on http://www.compareownerholidayrentals.com
891,Credit cards- how can you get a credit card if you don't have a credit history?,This is one of the vicious cycles that any new immigrant to the US faces. You can't get credit (a card or loan) without a credit history and you can't build a credit history without credit.One can start breaking this by getting a credit card with some stores  as recommended earlier  since they have lower bars of acceptance. Another way that is less harmful to your credit report is to apply for a pre-paid credit card from your bank. This is somewhat like a debit card  you put up money upfront and can then spend upto that amount. However  the difference is that it is still treated as credit and starts a positive credit history for you.After a few months  you can upgrade to a normal credit card from the bank and then a few months later apply for a credit card or loan from elsewhere

893,What is your opinion on online dating?,It works.  I met my bf of almost 3 years through online dating.  That doesn't mean I didn't meet alot of incompatible people.  I used online dating on and off for about a year before I met him.Online dating is just another way to meet people  but it shouldn't be the only way you meet people.  If you're banking on it working  it probably won't because you've invested too much emotionally and your expectations will colour your experience.  It works when you stop hoping each person you meet will be the one and instead  decide to just have fun with the experience  regardless of the outcome.  Yes  even a bad date can be fun.  Think of the anecdotes you can share with your friends.I find it takes a few weeks to get a feel for how things work.  Then  it's up and down for awhile depending on who you come into contact with.  When it doesn't feel fun anymore  TAKE A BREAK.  Come back in a few months.  Change your profile to reflect how you're feeling.It's important that you feel good about yourself or you won't attract the people you want because who wants to be with someone who's down on themselves?  Online dating is really a reflection of how you're  feeling.  When you feel good about yourself  your online experience improves.  When you feel bad  it tends to be a not so good experience.I was about to pull my dating profile because I found I was meeting lots of people through offline methods.  However  my friend pointed out that it wasn't costing me anything (financially or emotionally) if I just left my profile up.I thought she made a good point  so I decided to rewrite my profile one last time and put it out there.  When I rewrote it this time  I stopped caring about what other people would think about what I wrote or how they might judge me.  Instead  I wrote a profile that reflected exactly how I felt and who I was at that moment.And then  I started to meet interesting people.  Shortly thereafter  I met my bf and things have been going well since.
894,"In what year did Picasso start his ""blue phase""?",according to wikipedia...Picasso's Blue Period (1901–1904)  consisting of sombre  blue-tinted paintings influenced by a trip through Spain and the recent death of a friend  often featuring depictions of acrobats  harlequins  prostitutes  beggars and artists.

896,How are rice krispies made?,"They are made of a sugary rice mixture which is shaped into the form of rice kernels and toasted. These kernels bubble and rise in a manner which forms very thin walls. When the cereal is exposed to milk or juices  these walls tend to collapse suddenly  creating the famous ""Snap  crackle and pop"" sounds. This is in contrast to puffed rice  which was introduced in 1904."
897,Should I fly back to Sunnyvale (from WI) for the Year end party? Is it worth it?I'?,Whether any party would be worthy flying cross-country for is definitely up to you  but as far as company parties go  I think Yahoo's are tops.They go all out in so many ways.  The bands are impressively big (for a party) like this year's Earth  Wind  and Fire (http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aq6jtr59klox)  there is a huge variety of food and alcohol (including ice sculpture martini luges)  and lots of other activities (gambling  full-body video games).But despite all that  your enjoyment will probably be determined more by how much you enjoy being around your co-workers (if they're going)  your date  and/or how long you can enjoy gambling/dancing.The last two parties really really impressed me  but I enjoyed the second one much more because my date and I shared a great enthusiasm for the party and dancing.It doesn't look like last year's photos links work anymore :(

899,What's the history of a Labradoodle and why are they so popular now?,"Wally Conran  a breeder of guide dogs in Melbourne  Australia  was the first person to purposefully mate a labrador retriever and a standard poodle (the large kind) in 1988.  A woman in Hawaii had requested a Guide Dog for her disabled husband with allergies.  It took a while for Conran to hit upon the right mix  but the first litter produced three puppies  one of whose hair and saliva did not affect the man's allergies.He began breeding and cross-breeding the Labradoodles  which were in high demand almost immediately. ""The mix reputedly combines the intelligence  aloof nature  the delicate frame  and the low-allergy  and non-shedding traits of the poodle with the boisterous exuberance  lovability  and loyalty of a lab."""
900,How can I tell if the moon is waxing or waning?,For those who live in the Northern Hemisphere:The Moon is waxing or waning based on whether the right side of the Moon is dark or light.The Moon's lighted area increases over time from right to left.A good diagram of this can be found at: http://www.astro.umd.edu/education/astro/moon/waxing.gifFor those who live in the Southern Hemisphere the effect is the opposite.More details can be found at: http://www.astro.umd.edu/education/astro/moon/phases.html
901,What's the best  prosumer7MP digtal camera with removeable lenses?,The Canon Digital Rebel XT is a great camera.  I have professional photographer friends who use it as their primary camera.  8 megapixels and it's not crippled like the former Digital Rebel.  Also one of the smallest and lightest DSLR's on the market.  Consistently one of the most highly rated cameras  see the link below for a detailed review.Canon DSLR's are highly regarded and their lenses seem to be of comparable quality to Nikon while generally being cheaper.  A big advantage that Canon has is their vertical integration  they have the ability to engineer the electronics  lenses  and sensors all in house and save the best for themselves. This is the best camera you can get for under $1000.  I've seen it for as low as $700 in some places.I would also not be too hung up on the megapixel rating.  The 6.3 megapixel Nikon D50 and D70s are both great cameras and will take significant better pictures than 8 megapixel consumer digicams without interchangeable lenses.  However  unless I had a signficant investment in Nikon lenses  I would get the Canon.  Higher resolution  arguably better picture quality  and a lower price.
902,What do you call the 4-stringed Hawaiian instrument which looks like a little guitar?,"The ukulele  or uke  is a fretted string instrument. It's a smaller  four-stringed version of the guitar. In the early 20th century  the instrument's name was often rendered as ""ukelele""  a spelling still used in Great Britain. The Hawai'ian spelling 'ukulele is also sometimes seen."
903,What would cause you to not want to keep your friend anymore?,When they flirt with your boyfriend  then talk smack behind your back about how your boyfriend should have dumped you a long time ago.When you invite them somewhere  and they never commit  giving you the feeling that they are holding out for something better.When all they do is talk about themselves and never ask how you are doing  even when you don't see each other very often.When there is a misunderstanding and they won't accept your explanations  but readily accepts other people's interpretation of your actions.
904,What are the Seven Sisters schools? Are they considered as good colleges?,The seven sister schools are Smith  Vassar  Wellesley  Bryn Mawr  Mount Holyoke  Radcliffe and Barnard. Indeed  they are considered excellent colleges  I attended two of them myself!
905,why does the bird flu considered to be such a frightening disease?,"The 1918  1957 and and 1968 flu pandemics can be traced back to bird flu mutating with human virus. These pandemics killed scores of people. The panic also stems from the fact that there is no vaccine for H5N1 virus  the bird flu that is currently affecting Asia. Like last year  vaccines for ""regular"" human flu are in short supply as well.Under normal circumstances  when the flu hits you're just feverish  achey and fatigued for a few days. When the flu strikes more vulnerable people  like the elderly and very young babies  it can cause respiratory problems and even kill them."
906,What was up with the glass eyeball found in the Dharma bunker in episode #207 of Lost?,Early speculation seems to point to the eye belonging to the mysterious boat captain that abducted Walt along with the rest of the Others.

908,chicken biryani?,I have seen recipes that use both kinds of methods.Personally I prefer cooking them seperately and combining at the end. The chicken and rice are cooked seperately and then the rice is layered with chicken in the thick gravy alternately.Check out these recipes: http://www.recipedelights.com/recipes/nonvegdishes/chickenbiryani.htm(chicken and rice are cooked together in the end)(here they are cooked seperately):http://www.daawat.com/recipes/indian/rice/chickenbiryani.htm
909,What can be done to lower the dropout rate in High Schools?,"To curb the dropout rate  the National Dropout Prevention Center advocates the ""implementation of alternative strategies based on the principle of continuous improvement  in place of policies supporting student grade retention"".In other words  the organization believes that the qualifier of a meaningful education shouldn't solely be based on grades  but on individual performance.Each learner begins at a different level emotionally  socially  and cognitively  and behaviorally. And because all of these factors play a role in learning  the same standard shouldn't apply to every student.The NDPC thinks that more dropouts could be prevented if each child was assessed as an invidividual and their progress was weighed on their individual needs  not based against every other student.One of the best educational strategies they recommend is service-learning. This is a theory based on the connection of hands-on experience and academic learning that also incorporates service to the community. Many learners have shown they can grasp concepts better and have greater success through experiential learning instead of the traditional textbook/lecture/text based learning.hope this helps!"
910,Which are the best places to take kids to in New York City during Christmas?,Definitely the Lincoln Center skating rink. Its such a symbol  and there's always a lot going on around that area (with NBC Studios near by).  Then there's a huge toy store  FAO Schwarz  that's fun to play in w/ or w/o your kids. I think this is where they filmed part of the movie  Big  by Tom Hanks.Here's the address:New York767 Fifth Avenue(Fifth Avenue at 58th Street)New York  NY 10153212-644-9400 ext. 4242Holiday HoursNovember 25  2005 through December 25  2005:Mon - Sat: 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.Sun: 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
911,What breeds of cats and dogs can live together?,Cornish Rex cats usually do very well with dogs.  Most Cornish are very smart  friendly  outgoing  fearless and playful and love having dog pals to chase  wrestle and cuddle with.  The best advice I can give is make sure the rescue groups/breeders you contact either ask for extensive info about your family/dogs or has met them.  This way  they can select the best fit personality and behavior wise.
912,Does anyone have a recommendation for a good real estate agent in Houston?,My father actually is a real estate agent for Keller Williams in Houston and although I may be biased  he's very attentive and goes out of his way on every single deal he negotiates.

914,My maine coone cat is getting older (14 years). How should I supplement her diet so she gets optimal nutrition,Hi Is she generally healthy?  Have you taken her in recently for a full blood panel?  At 14  it's very important to check for declining kidney  thyroid and liver function.  These are very common issues and usually manageable with diet.If she's generally healthy and doesn't require a low-protein or other special diet  there's a great dry food out there called EVO made by Innova.  No supplements are needed when feeding it.  My cats  both young and old  have really thrived on it.  Wellness is another great food; Royal Canin also makes a special Maine Coon formula.Hope this helps--
915,What is paraphrasing?,Paraphrasing is when you put someone else's ideas in your own words. It's not just rewriting a paragraph or changing a few words. From the webs ite below:Paraphrasing is:*your own rendition of essential information and ideas expressed by someone else  presented in a new form.*one legitimate way (when accompanied by accurate documentation) to borrow from a source.*a more detailed restatement than a summary  which focuses concisely on a single main idea.Be careful about taking a sentence and only changing a few words in it--some plagarism detecting software will catch that and call it plagarism.

919,When was the original Mini first launched? When did the new MINI  launch?,The original Mini was built in 1959  for the British Motorcar Corporation.  Bear in mind that this predates the BMW acquisition of the brand from Rover in 1994 by many  many years.  The new Mini launched in 2001 as a 2002 model.  Interestingly the original mini was built all the way to 2000  making it one of the longest lived automotive desitns.
920,Which came first  the chicken or the egg?,This is actually very easy to answer  based on evolution the egg had to come first. Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise  many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous  making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect  making no change from parent to progeny.In the case of the chicken  it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However  whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken  that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along.So the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?

This TV is also currently available at Costco for $1699  where it is called Panasonic TH42PM50U."

924,What is the best tasting Turkey substitute?,For vegetarian Turkey substitutes  I personally prefer the Quorn roast over Tofurkey.  It's cheaper  smaller (both of which are better for the lone vegetarian in a crowd of meat eaters)  and tastes better to me.Downside - I don't think there is a Quorn roast sold with stuffing  so you'll have to figure out how to make sure you get a vegetarian version of that.

Web 3.0 is more likely to be a mix of technologies like web2.o  VoIP  social networking  blogging  mobile  syncing mobile(wap) with the web..Like a consumer shopping on eBay can click on call button to directly bargain with the seller if he is online (making use of VoIP)and with eBays acquisition of Skype this is most likely to happen
927,Why do we use xmas trees at xmas?,The evergreen tree in ancient religions was a symbol of the renewal of life.  However  the modern practice seems to have originated in 16th century Germany  where Bremen guild articles describe the practice of decorating a fir tree with apples  nuts  dates and paper flowers which were collected by the family children on Christmas.
928,What's the best John Coltrane album?,"Coltrane's SoundThis album is like many Coltrane albums palpably in transition between styles. It follows on from the experiments with dense  irregularly moving chord changes of ""Giant Steps""  and also contains a couple reharmonized standards  ""The Night Has a Thousand Eyes"" and ""Body and Soul""  which have areas of sustained modal exploration in the manner of ""My Favourite Things"". The band is the first edition of the ""classic"" Coltrane band  with Steve Davis on bass before Jimmy Garrison hopped on board.What's most unusual about this album  perhaps  is that it's actually Coltrane's meditation on the bop heritage. Only one tune is completely original  the lovely ballad ""Central Park West"" (one of my favourite Coltrane tracks; he only states the melody  leaving the improvisation to Tyner  but it's so rounded a statement that like Monk's ""Crepuscule with Nellie"" it doesn't really need elaboration at all). The other tunes rework standard bop fare via the techniques of movement in thirds and pedal notes that obsessed Coltrane in this period. ""Liberia"" is a version of ""A Night in Tunisia""; ""Equinox"" is a minor blues but borrows its intro from Parker's intro to ""Star Eyes""; ""Satellite"" is a reworking of ""How High the Moon""/""Ornithology""; ""26-2"" (a rather mysterious title) is a version of ""Confirmation"". The practice was of course already there on _Giant Steps_ (""Giant Steps"" and ""Countdown"" are themselves based on standards like ""Tune Up"") but the concentration of such material &the tenor sax shibboleth ""Body and Soul""  suggest a rather more self-conscious exploration of the tradition. (Note that Coltrane's albums otherwise rarely contain bop tunes  preferring to concentrate on pop standards when not playing originals.) The quartet's take on these tunes is dark  intense and brooding--this album is a long way from the sunny mood of _Giant Steps_&_Coltrane Jazz_."

931,What is the best cruise line for someone in their 20's?,"Carnival has done a good job of branding themselves as ""The Fun Ships"" with a singles party atmosphere  but there are other great choices for singles depending on your interest  preferences or budget.Royal Carribbean also has built some *huge* ships with interesting sports amenities (rock climbing wall  ice rink  surfing pool(!!)  etc) which are good for active singles.  And I've heard they also are a great place to meet people.If you want to go on a smaller  more intimate ship  I've heard Windstar is great. It's more luxurious but also more expensive.The cruise lines to avoid (which tend to have an older over 50 crowd) are Holland America and Princess (also more expensive than RC or Carnival)The Cruise Critic website is a great source of cruise and cruise line reviews."
932,Can anyone recommend a museum around Chicago?,When I was a kid  I loved the Museum of Science and Industry.  It's very tactile in that you can interact with most of the exhibits rather than just observing them.If you enjoy art  the Art Institute of Chicago is world-class and very close to other attractions in Chicago such as Millenium Park.  Otherwise  the Museum of Contemporary Art is again world-class and is adjacent to the Gold Coast area.
933,What's the best remedy for the 'dark circles' around the eyes?,There are several reasons for dark circles. One of the biggest cause is lack of sleep. The solution is to get more sleep. Sleep deprivation is not only giving you dark circles  but it is also bad for your skin.Another reason is heredity. There is not much you can do to eliminate it if it's hereditary. Applying concealer will help. I like Bobbi Brown's Creamy Concealer. For very dark circles  I use their Corrector.There are some cosmetic creams that claim to brighten dark circles with Vitamin K or skin lightening ingredients. But I have not seen any success either on myself or people that I know.

935,could u suggest me trendy&cool plaves where to buy forniture in San Francisco?,I will assume that trendy means modern. And I will assume that by cheap you mean something other than Ligne or the 5 other places in SoMa (but if you just search for furniture on Yahoo! Local within the SoMa area  you can see for yourself).Given that  I highly recommend Scandinavian Designs. I got almost all my stuff there and the most expensive item I got was $700 which is about 1/3 of what you would expect. It's also very high quality and _heavy_ which to me is a good sign.

Earlier when you did not have the router  were you entering the login/password to connect to internet? If so  you have to configure your cable/dsl modem to host the login/password. For SBC DSL modem you can do it by http://192.168.1.0/ and there is a option available in ""advanced configuration"" to do that.3. Did you connect the ethernet cable from the cable/dsl modem to theWAN port of the router?4. Are you getting the Dynamic IP assigned by the router? Check it by Start-Run-Cmd-ipconfig. It should show you some IP address like 192.168.1.x.5. Run the following command in the command window (start-Run-cmd)ping www.yahoo.comHope this helps."
938,Why do women get PMS?,Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of symptoms related to the menstrual cycle. PMS is linked to changes in the endocrine system  which produces hormones that control the menstrual cycle. Medical experts don't fully understand the chain of events that causes premenstrual symptoms to be severe in some women and not in others. The one direct cause that is known to affect some women is genetic: Many women with PMS have a close family member with a history of PMS.

947,Is there such a thing as a soulmate?,YES!  Unlike the previous post  however  my soulmate and I share little in common  except our enjoyment of each other's company and our love.  A soulmate is not someone who you share everything in common with; it's someone who you were meant to be with for life.I don't know if you can say much more than that.  Finding your soulmate is a very personal thing.  When it happens you will know.  Don't try to force it to happen before that.
948,How can we improve the quality of the teachers in high schools?,hi This question is of particular interest to me because I have been interested in education reform for some time. I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. To have quality teachers  many different initiatives should be put into place.There are several areas to focus on improving teachers:1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS.2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. it's not suprising. they're essentially expected to raise our society's children and many times spend more time when them than the parents do. that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers.3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take  it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. a teacher who passes this test gets a raise as well as the privelege of teaching in any other state w/o additional requirements.4) accountability- it's a problem when non-performing teachers are allowed to stay because of tenure. while it's important to ensure teacher accountability  it seems that some states see this area as a panacea for generating good teachers. it's not. the other factors are equally important  if not more so. to weed out deadbeats  you just have to nurture a better teaching staff.5) fair compensation- obviously  this is very important.hope this helps?

950,Is Buying a Hybrid Car worth the extra 5000 dollars.?,Currently  there is no financial justification for buying a hybrid vehicle based on fuel costs alone.  In california  the tax credit and ability to drive in the HOV lane mitigate this somewhat  but unfortunately the Escape Hybrid is only eligible for the federal $2K tax deduction but not the california clean air tax credit. Click on the link below for an analysis from the WSJ's detroit bureau chief on his analysis of the cost benefits of owning a hybrid vehicle.Also included is an in-depth analysis from Omninerd that breaks it down for you.  Essentially  you should do it for the feel good environmental reasons and not necessarily savings from fuel.
951,what was Hitchcock best movie?,Generally  film geeks tend to come down in favor of Vertigo or Notorious  but the previously mentioned North By Northwest gets a lot of votes  too.Notorious is usually cited by European critics because of the amazing work by both Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman  plus it is the film that introduced the concept of the McGuffin. Essentially  this is the plot device that everything seems to be hinging upon while the story is doing something else (much sneakier) in the background. In Notorious  the McGuffin is (are) the wine bottles full of uranium.I tend to think that Vertigo is his best because it's just so damn unbelievable and over-the-top but he still pulls it off. Jimmy Stewart was never better in his whole career and the cinematography  music and mood is just amazing.Other (not yet mentioned) great Hitchcock films that you must see would be:1. Early Period: The Thirty-Nine Steps (1939)  The Lady Vanishes  Strangers on a Train2. Middle-Period: The Trouble with Harry (very funny)  Suspicion  Rebecca3. Later: Rear Window  and Psycho (of course)
952,"Can someone tell me what ""break a leg"" means?",It's a traditional way to wish actors good luck before a performance.  Theatrical superstition has it that it's bad luck to wish someone good luck in a play  so instead  you say something with the opposite meaning.    However  there are some alternative theories about the origin of this saying -- see reference below.

963,What is the best type of puppy for a family with 3 kids under 10?,Don't get a terrier for a group of small children! You need a dog that will put up with abuse. Labs  beagles  poodles  and border collies are good choices.If you get a herding dog  they'll help you keep the kids from wandering away. A border collie would be perfect for this. They're smart enough to do the kid's homework as well.
964,How can we make teaching more attractive to young people?,"Higher salaries- for the amount of education that a teacher has to have  their pay is a pittance.  What other careers do you know where people with a master's degree in their chosen field start out around $35 000/ year  or less?  The pay level is ridiculous- so low that teachers usually can not live on their salaries unless they are married to someone else who works  or have a second job.Second  reduce the workload.  Most don't realize that a teacher's workday is not limited to 8 hours or so they are at school.  When you add in the lesson planning and grading that must be done on your own time  the constant parent conferences  meetings  paperwork and evaluations  and training sessions that they throw at you  you're normally working the equivalent of 10-12 hour days  and filling up your entire weekends with it.  Then add in more trainings and classes that they require you to take during your ""vacation"" times  and there's practically no break.Third- allow them to teach!!  So much of the time is taken up with madated tests  evaluations  and forced mucky muck that teaching doesn't get to happen anywhere near as often as it should.And lastly- give teachers a break!  Literally.  Breaks are few and far between and dreadful are the times when you have to ""go"" and can't because there is no one else to watch your class.In short  teachers need help in a lot of ways."
965,Should both computers use the same OS to share my DSL?,DSL usually requires PPPoE connections. Most consumer routers will provide this functionality for you. Simply enter your username and password into the router and it will maintain a persistent connection for you.Then  each computer on your network can simply obtain a DHCP address from the router and use the Internet without any special software.Windows  Linux  MacOS  and other operating systems should be compatible with little or no configuration.

968,im thinking of buying a house on landfill in the bay area what are your thoughts?,Check and see what your insurance rates would be. It may be difficult and very expensive to get insurance  particularly earthquake coverage  which in turn will make it difficult to secure a mortgage.Also  make sure you go over the disclosure package very very carefully  and have your own property inspection done. Some shifting or damage to the foundation may already have happened.Not knowing exactly where you're talking about  my gut instinct would be to pass on this house and find another in a safer area.
969,How is it that different countries have come up with different styles of electrical socket pins?,Practical: As there are multiple very-incompatible voltages in use (110v  220v)  it's a good idea to not have the same plugs. Somebody will inevitably plug in the wrong device  and putting a 110v device on 220v can be pretty nasty. Dual voltage devices which are popular today (largely due to power semiconductors which make them inexpensive)  didn't exist when plugs were designed!Political: Many ex-colonies of Britain were trying to shake off British influence as far as possible  which probably was a factor in picking different system for power device standards  among others.
970,Where's the best place to get my FICO score?,you are entitled to free fico score reports. you might try myfico.net. Its the consumer site that Fair Isaac provides  you can get free FICO reports there. Fair Isaac is the company that created the FICO score and has a lot of power over your ability to get loans and such from banks. Its a very interesting business.
971,Should I rent or buy?,"It depends on what you mean by ""save a lot of money"".  If you are trying to save money over a period of time  it depends.  Over the long haul you might save money by buying  since you'll end up owning the property and could sell it and recover your investment.  You might even make money by buying if you live in an area where the property value is likely to go up over the period of time you might live there.If you're trying to save money on a monthly basis  renting is usually cheaper  unless a) you might rent out one or more rooms  thus off-setting your out-of-pocket monthly expenses  or b) you can afford to put down a large down-payment.Living in a high-cost area myself  I say ""buy"" if you can afford it.  If nothing else you can go to town on decorating or remodeling  something you can't usually do when you rent."
972,What makes AMG different from other Mercedes-Benz vehicles?,AMG (Aufrecht Melcher Grossaspach) was the leading independent tuner of Mercedes-Benz automobiles when they were purchased by the company in the mid 1990's.  AMG vehicles are meant to be the highest performing model for a specific model line (though not necessarily the most luxurious).  They have handbuilt motors  upgraded brakes and suspension  and exclusive interior and exterior featuers.  Since they are factory built they are covered by a manufacturer's warranty.  They are also produced in relatively limited numbers.  They can be identified by the badge on the trunk  as well as the two digit model designation.  (i.e. C32 vs C320)
973,Why do women love to gossip?,Men and women (not just women) love to gossip.  It entertains them.  I've noticed that some people gossip because they have low self-esteem.  They think that if they gossip about a person and try to bring them down  it makes them feel good and brings themselves up.  Some people also gossip because they are jealous of the person they gossip about.

975,What's the best gas station to fill up en route to SF Airport  when coming from Sunnyvale?,"I would use the Mathilda Shell Gas/Filling/Petrol Station which is conveniently located near the 101-N highway  so you can get right on the freeway to the airport (SFO).The airport is still close enough that your gas indicator will be on the ""F""  so no gas charge.The Mathilda Shell station is located here:776 N Mathilda Ave  Sunnyvale  CA 94085-3510Directions from the Yahoo! Sunnyvale office to station:http://maps.yahoo.com/dd_result?newaddr=701+First+Avenue&taddr=776+N+Mathilda+Ave&csz=94089&country=us&tcsz=Sunnyvale+CA&tcountry=us&oerr=-3001&name=Y%21+SunnyvaleOnward directions to the airport:Just turn right out of the station and the on-ramp to 101-N is on the right  just across the intersection.Good luck!"
976,Which mortgage is best for me: 30 year fixed rate or 5/1 ARM?,ARM typically will have a lower introductory interest rate.  If you definitely plan on selling your home within 5 years  then an ARM would probably be the choice for you.After the 5 years  however  the rate may jump into double digit percentages  which can be a shocking surprise.A 30-year fixed rate has the advantage of always knowing you'll have the same monthly mortgage payment all the way.  It typically will have a higher interest rate than the ARM.
977,what is the reason behind thanksgiving holidays?,The Pilgrim Hall Museum in Plymouth  MA provides a history of the original Thanksgiving and the subsequent history of the holiday with references to both primary and secondary sources. The website link is below.About half of the original group of Mayflower passengers coming to America had perished during the voyage or during the first year. The 50 or so surviving Pilgrims celebrated their first successful harvest in the Fall of 1621 in Plymouth  MA. This is considered the origin of the present-day Thanksgiving. It was a harvest celebration with prayers of thanksgiving for provision  and safety. And being Puritan Separatists  the giving of thanks was to their God  Jesus Christ.The website discusses additional details concerning the English-speaking Indians  the mix of passengers  and the Mayflower compact.Regarding the evolution of the holiday  the website contains the text of the annual Thanksgiving proclamations of Congress and the President since 1777. The first Continental Congress published the first such proclamation expressing gratefulness to God for the outcome of the War of Independence. George Washington published the first Presidential proclamation in 1789 expressing gratefulness to God for the establishment of the new form of government. However  observance of the holiday remained  effectively  an optional state initiative until Lincoln declared a national  annual Thanksgiving holiday in October of 1863. He was moved by events in the Civil War. In this proclamation Lincoln expresses gratitude to God for protection from foreign threats during the Civil War and preservation of the union in the Civil War. Presidents have declared an annual  national day of Thanksgiving ever since. In 1939 it is said FDR tried to move the day of Thanksgiving up to extend the Christmas season. The resulting controversy motivated Congress to fix the date in 1941 to the 4th Thursday in November  which is where it remains to this date.

980,My toddler is fussy about eating. Should I keep trying to feed him or let him eat by himself only?,I would let him feed himself - and don't worry too much about the spoon  fingers work well. My kids started feeding themselves in daycare from about 9 months. Kids tend to be faddy - trick is to find this weeks fads. You are going to need foods that they can pick up - you may need to put the food on the table  if plates get thrown to the floor. One thing I noticed  peer pressure is great  at daycare my kids always eat because their friends do. Foods that I have found that always seem to work that they can pick up: cheese sticks  bread sticks  rice cakes  bread  bagel with cream cheese  beans (black beans  baked beans  raisins  pasta with or without tomato sauce (cut with scissors if necessary so they are the right size to pick up).  It is great - you get a chance to eat yourself once they feed themselves. Clean up is more time consuming though. I always ask at daycare what they like (tofu!)

982,Best music podcasts?,I like the ones from kexp.org.  I listen to their daily radio shows using the audio streams.

984,what is the best podcast to subscribe to?,This Week in Tech is a great podcast.  It's hosted by Leo Laport (of TechTV fame) and features several guests each week  usually other ex-TechTV people and John Devorak.  It's basically a discussion of tech news stories from the week.  It's been the top podcast for some time now  probably because of the well known  intelligent hosts as well as the professional production quality.Browsing the podcasts available on iTunes can be a good way to easily sample some podcasts on topics you're interested in.
985,What can you say to someone on their deathbed to help put their mind at ease?,It really depends on the beliefs of the individual. If they are religious  talk to them about their beliefs about the afterlife. If they are worried about how their actions in life may affect their disposition after death  recall for them (if possible) their good works and deeds. If they believe in God  remind them of the principles of divine forgiveness. If they're not religious  ask them about their beliefs. Reassure them of their impact on your life. If you're there at their bedside  I assume they've touched you somewhat  somehow.This is not a time to hold a grudge. If you have a disagreement with them  try to forgive. Remember you will have to live with yourself after the other person is gone. Let them know you will remember them fondly. Recall good times with them to help ease their pain.
986,What's the best body lotion for sensitive skin?,What don't you like about Eucerin? It is what my daughter's pediatrician recommended when she was very small.

987,what's the difference between xbox 360 and ps3 and which should i buy?,I'd be wary of any CNN articles surrounding the PS3. Given the business relationship between Sony and CNN  I'd take everything that CNN has to say about Sony products with a grain of salt. Likewise  I'd do the same for any MSNBC article about the Xbox 360.With that particular article mentioned in the previous answer  please note that CNN issued a retraction on some of the information that was provided regarding the costs of the PS3 (See the bottom of the article). This casts doubt on the integrity of some of the other facts mentioned.Here's an article about some of the best reasons to get an Xbox 360:http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/668/668897p1.htmland here's one from the same site that gives you the  best reasons to wait for the PS3:http://ps3.ign.com/articles/668/668446p1.htmlIn truth  I wouldn't suggest following any one person's recommendations. I'd do the research on each console and see which appeals to you most.
988,Why is the sky blue?,The sky is blue due to atmospheric scattering of blue light. Blue photons are the most energetic of the visible light photos  and interact more with the atmosphere as a result. To be clear  all colors get scattered  it s just that blue is affected the most because of it is more energetic.   A related effect happens around sunset. At this time of day  sunlight needs to travel through significantly more air to reach your eyes. The length of air is so long that nearly all the blue and green is scattered away before it reaches you. All that is left is yellows  oranges and reds  some of which reaches your eyes  and the rest scattered in the sky within your view.

990,Is it OK to buy a used Home Theater system?,At a minimum you want 5.1 audio with both DTS and Dolby Digital support.  Beyond that you see diminishing returns  as there's a HUGE leap between Dolby Pro Logic and Dolby Digital sound.  Essentially the 5.1 means there are 5 independent full range channels with a completely independent LFE (low frequency effects) channel.The difference between DTS and Dolby Digital are subtle at best  theoretically DTS is a less compressed format with higher resolution but in the end it comes down the the sound engineering behind the tracks for each individual movie.  However  it's now virtually standard on all receivers and there are many DTS encoded dvds now.There are a few newer standards like Dolby Digital EX and DTS-ES which add an extra center channel or two to the rear  but in my opinion the extra cost of the speakers is better spent on building a solid 5 speaker (+ subwoofer) system.  Also  in the home placing a rear center channel is problematic and in my opinion more trouble than it's worth.  If you can get a higher end and better built (but older) 5.1 receiver  that's a much better use of your money than a lower end 7.1 system.  Also  the new formats are completely backward compatible with the older ones  so there are no compatibility issues with older gear.The 5.1 standards have been out for about 10 years now  but there are no real breakthroughs on the home theater front.  The only thing that I would recommend in terms of future proofing is a set of 5.1 channel inputs on your receiver for an external decoder  though at this point I don't know what that new audio standard would be.I haven't really mentioned the high def audio formats like SACD or DVD Audio because there isn't a lot of media and to truly take advantage of the better sound you'd have to make a BIG investment in speakers and improving the acoustics of your room.For speakers  definitely don't skimp.  My favorite brands (bang for the buck) are Paradigm  PSB  and Energy.  Energy has a sub/sat line called the Take 5 which is all the speakers + subwoofer you need for around $700.  There is a newer model called act6 which is around $800 and is quite good.  In terms of receivers  Denon is good all around  and Yamaha makes good receivers towards the high end. Onkyo is also good. Sony is not great.  Lots of features and nice looking gear but sonically not as good as Denon  Onkyo  or the nicer Yamahas.  When in doubt  see if the receiver is made in Japan.  Usually the Japanese brands reserve their higher spec gear from the Japanese plants.  There is plenty of good stuff which is not made there  but if it is you're in good shape.I have a Yamaha RXV-2095 which I bought in 1999 and I feel like I have no reason to upgrade for the next few years.  It's a solid receiver with lots of clean amplification.Also  if five speakers is a lot of scratch  you can still have great home theater with just the 3 front speakers and a subwoofer.
991,What are the major differences between the Prius and the Civic Hybrid?,Depends on the kind of driving you do.  There are two types of hybrid systems  parallel and series.  A parallel hybrid  like the Toyota and Ford systems  employs a separate electric motor and gas engine connected in parallel to the wheels.  Systems like these tend to be better for city driving  and this is usually reflected in the higher EPA city ratings for parallel hybrids.  Parallel hybrids have  until very recently  been the only system that allows independent operation of the electric and gas motors  where the car can operate in pure electric mode at low speeds when the battery has a good charge.The Honda employs a series hybrid where the motor is integrated into the transmission and is connected in series to the drive wheels.  These systems typically offer better highway mileage than parallel hybrids but slightly worse around town.  Also typical with these systems is the inability to run the car in pure electric mode  though this has changed with the 2006 Civic Hybrid.While the Prius has been the state of the art in hybrid technology  it is my opinion that the new 2006 Civic Hybrid is the superior vehicle.  It was designed from the ground up with the Prius as a benchmark  and the designers have hit their mark.I think the Civic will end up being a better driving experience.  The platform was engineered to be the basis for the next generation of Honda vehicles  and the 2006 Civic Si  also based on the same platform  is considered to be the best in its class.  The hybrid shares the same basic suspension as the Si  and will undoubtedly be compatible with the multitude of aftermarket suspension upgrades which will become available shortly for the 2006 civic.

Dogs groan because they're in pain or afraid (soft groan)  excited (gasping)  wanting something (continuous groaning)  communicating with others (howling)  or just sighing of boredom or disappointment.  If you're worried that she's groaning because she's in pain or there could be something wrong  take her to her vet -- someone I'm sure would be able to figure out what's so upsetting to her.
