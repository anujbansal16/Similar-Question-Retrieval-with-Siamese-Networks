310,what is your favorite quotation from Henry David Thoreau ?,However mean your life is  meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life  poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant  thrilling  glorious hours  even in a poorhouse. The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the almshouse as brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there  and have as cheering thoughts  as in a palace. Quoted from the final chapter of Walden.  Best `k.
897,Should I fly back to Sunnyvale (from WI) for the Year end party? Is it worth it?I'?,Whether any party would be worthy flying cross-country for is definitely up to you  but as far as company parties go  I think Yahoo's are tops.They go all out in so many ways.  The bands are impressively big (for a party) like this year's Earth  Wind  and Fire (http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aq6jtr59klox)  there is a huge variety of food and alcohol (including ice sculpture martini luges)  and lots of other activities (gambling  full-body video games).But despite all that  your enjoyment will probably be determined more by how much you enjoy being around your co-workers (if they're going)  your date  and/or how long you can enjoy gambling/dancing.The last two parties really really impressed me  but I enjoyed the second one much more because my date and I shared a great enthusiasm for the party and dancing.It doesn't look like last year's photos links work anymore :(

542,My boyfriend and I broke up because he is busy at work  should I wait for him?,Move on.  He's not into you.  You should read the book He's just not that into you by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo.      Go straight to Chapter 2.
111,Is Trigonometry considered high school or college level math?,"In the US  Trig is normally considered as a high school level course  however  it is not a required course to graduate. I believe Algebra is the highest of the high school math courses that are required for graduation  although some schools may still only require Geometry.In the US the typical sequence for math courses is Pre-Algebra  Geometry  Algebra  Trigonometry and then Calculus (which is usually taken at the high school level as Pre-Calculus  but may also be taken as full ""AP"" Calculus  where the ""AP"" stands for ""Advanced Placement"" and means that the student can get University-level credit for that course when they go to College)."
748,Why do people shop only after Thanksgiving?,The day after Thanksgiving marks the start of the Christmas shopping season.  People get into the spirit of Christmas after Thanksgiving.People love sales. Shopping the day after Thanksgiving and the day after Christmas is like a tradition.  It's one of the days when retail stores make a big profit.For some people  they don't want to wait. They want to start early and get a better gift selection.  They don't want to get up at 6am and wait in line.I am a last minute shopper.  I get better deals two days before Christmas day.  The stores I usually go to offer 20% off on items that have been previously marked down 40% or 50%.
200,Best gifts to bring back from San Francisco?,I would go to the SF Ferry Building and pick from the fantastic selection of shops/goodies there...in particular  some chocolate from Scharffenberger or Michael Recchuiti (both bay area natives and expert chocolatiers)--you can easily find stuff for under $40.If you go on a Saturday morning  I'd go to the the Farmer's Market (which is in back of the Ferry Building) and pick up some June Taylor preserves  which are beautifully packaged  seasonal and delicious. Each jar is about $11.
850,Do schools need better teachers or more funding? Why?,Both  and neither.  Schools need better support for their current teachers to help them become better.  There's an over 50% turnover rate of new teachers in the first year.  A little high  don't you think?  A lot of it is about administrative and group support  new teachers a lot of times are thrown to the wolves.  Better support a lot of times doesn't exist because the funding isn't there for teacher development  so it's a catch-22.

595,Why do people have the bird  turkey for thanksgiving?,"It is believed that the pilgrims and indians shared wild turkey and venison on the original Thanksgiving.Turkey's ""Americanness"" was established by Benjamin Franklin  who had advocated for the turkey  not the bald eagle  becoming the national bird."
564,I need to get a wireless card for my laptop. Are all cards compatible with all laptops? Which one is best?,Q: Are all cards compatible?A: Not quite.If your laptop is a Mac Powerbook or iBook  you should get a USB wireless network adapter.And regardless if it's a Windows or Mac laptop  it's a good idea to double-check that it doesn't already have wireless capability built-in (most do nowadays).Assuming your laptop runs Windows  doesn't have a built-in wireless adapter  and is a relatively recent model (a Pentium II or newer CPU is a good hint)  then just about any wireless card will work and you skip the rest of this explanation.If your laptop is more than 7 or 8 years old  you need to make sure it supports CardBus PCMCIA cards.  Many wireless PCMCIA cards use the CardBus interface - it provides higher performance than the standard PCMCIA interface.  Unfortunately  CardBus slots look just like a regular PCMCIA slot  so you can't tell if your laptop supports them just by looking.You can  however  easily tell if a wireless PCMCIA card uses CardBus or not.  If it has a gold strip on top the end that goes into the PCMCIA slot  then it's a CardBus PCMCIA card.  Many manufacturers of wireless PCMCIA cards offer them using both interfaces.  Here's an example of a Siemens card (along with pictures that clearly show the difference between a regular PCMCIA card and CardBus card):http://kb.efficient.com/display/1n/articleDirect/index.asp?aid=45947&r=0.1037256Q: Which one is best?A: It depends on what your wireless network supports.  But  in general  there are several good options and at very reasonable prices.WARNING: If you want to buy a wireless card to use at work though  you MUST check with your IT department before buying anything.  First  they should really provide a wireless card - you shouldn't have to buy one.  Second  businesses often configure their wireless networks to use specific security features  and you want to make sure you buy equipment that will be compatible.OK  assuming you want to use this for wireless connectivity at home  then just about any wireless card that supports 802.11g (aka Wireless-G) will suffice.  I say that because most equipment for wireless home networks sold today uses the 802.11g standard.  And anything that you buy nowadays will provide more than adequate security and encryption options.Choice of brand matters a lot  though I can't recommend a single one because you really want to get the same brand as the rest of your wireless networking equipment.  For instance  if you have a Linksys wireless router at home  then get a Linksys wireless card.  Technically  most of the wireless equipment is compatible with each other (I won't get into the gory details of why that's not always true)  but if you get equipment from the same brand  then you know it's been tested by the manufacturer to be compatible.  And the software you use to setup the various pieces of equipment will be very similar and use the same descriptions for various options - that should make things less confusing.  If you're buying the other networking equipment too (e.g. the wireless router)  then I recommend Linksys.  I've never been disappointed by their products - good performance  reliability  support and at very good prices to boot.  And you can find their products in almost any major retail store that carries computer products (like Best Buy).Hope this helps!

It's hosted by Leo Laport (of TechTV fame) and features several guests each week  usually other ex-TechTV people and John Devorak.  It's basically a discussion of tech news stories from the week.  It's been the top podcast for some time now  probably because of the well known  intelligent hosts as well as the professional production quality.Browsing the podcasts available on iTunes can be a good way to easily sample some podcasts on topics you're interested in.
971,Should I rent or buy?,"It depends on what you mean by ""save a lot of money"".  If you are trying to save money over a period of time  it depends.  Over the long haul you might save money by buying  since you'll end up owning the property and could sell it and recover your investment.  You might even make money by buying if you live in an area where the property value is likely to go up over the period of time you might live there.If you're trying to save money on a monthly basis  renting is usually cheaper  unless a) you might rent out one or more rooms  thus off-setting your out-of-pocket monthly expenses  or b) you can afford to put down a large down-payment.Living in a high-cost area myself  I say ""buy"" if you can afford it.  If nothing else you can go to town on decorating or remodeling  something you can't usually do when you rent."
