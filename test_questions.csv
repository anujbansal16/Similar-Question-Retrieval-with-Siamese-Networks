51549,I was being curious  how do you get rid of toe nail fungus and how do you know you have it?,Warren's answer is good  but it is important to know that it could take as long as 6 to 8 months for all of the infected nail to grow out if the infection is heavy. Rub the vaporub in under the nail and all the way around the cuticle too. It doesn't take much but it must be rubbed in well. It is also very helpful to trim the nail as short as possible without going into the quick. Be patient and this WILL WORK without the risk of serious liver side-effects that lamosil can produce. Good luck!

78296,About my last question regarding Maxwell Wheel.?,ok.  call the downward translational velocity of the whole thing v.  this means that the tangential velocity at the edge of the poles (at the radius r) is equal to v.  the reason for this is that the strings are wound AROUND THE POLES  so this winding and the condition that the string has to unwrap for the thing to move  sets the angular velocity w = v/r.now  if you look at the main wheel part  the angular velocity has to be equal to the angular velocity of the poles  since they are one solid piece.  however  as you note the radius of the wheel Rr.  so  the fact that v / r = w = V / R implies that Vv.  in other words  the motion of the outer edges of the wheel is faster than the motion of the outer edges of the rods.i think you are getting confused by saying that V is the translational velocity of the wheel.  it's not.  v is the translational velocity of the wheel  and of the rods.  the fact that the string is wound *around the rods* and not around the wheel sets the angular velocity of the whole apparatus equal to v/r.  V  the tangential velocity of the outer edges of the wheel  is much faster than the translational velocity.that clear?

27127,What is the true color of our Blood?,In humans and other hemoglobin-using creatures  oxygenated blood is a bright red in color. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red  which can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken. However  due to an optical effect caused by the way in which light penetrates through the skin  veins typically appear blue in color. This has led to a common misconception that before venous blood is exposed to air it is blue.
